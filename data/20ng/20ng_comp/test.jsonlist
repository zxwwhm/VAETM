I wanted to get the\noutline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously\nsuprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I\nsuspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline\nvery irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines\n(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most\ncommon mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and\ntangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of\nthe coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive\nalgorithm that would let you step in and say \"no, dummy, you're going the\nwrong way\".\n\n\tSteve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his\ndoctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).\nA good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized\nmicrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.\nThis is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with\nits auto-trace tool.\n\n\tIn some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he\nwas trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a\ngood centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future\nanalysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem\nsince the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the\nvirus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be\nrestricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,\nclean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real\nlife images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult\nthis problem is to solve in the general case.\n\n\t(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while\non vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last\nknown location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.

The user site can enter their\nsite-specific \"batch profile\" into a dataset within our product, specifying\nthe pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,\netc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is\nwritten to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and\nrun the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as\nthe job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the\ninteractive session.\n\nAs currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80\ncharacters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in\nbatch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a\nproblem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.\nMVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single\ncommand across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is\n*STANDARD* with OS/2).\n\nThe gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not\nwithin my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.\nSince my first posting I've learned that there are several third party\ncompanies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.\nAnd I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative\nscript language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption\nthat they have anything other than what comes with NT.\n\nI saw another post on this list (the subject was something like \"Is vi\navailable for Windows?\") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and\n***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is\nit a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I\ncould count on it at all NT sites.\n\nOne last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,\ni.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run\nthere.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific\ncommands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment\non these commands, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks again for the help,\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Bass                           |  SAS Institute Inc.\nIntegrated Systems, A216, x6975      |  SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC  27513-2414\nsasswb@k2.unx.sas.com                |  (919) 677-8001 x6975\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}

I'd opt for the battery change, though.\n\nIt's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is \ncorrupting the CMOS.

It's compatible with the\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\n    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\n\tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\n\tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\n\tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\n\n    See Also:\n\tMixing X11 and OpenWindows\n\tWhere can I get it?\n\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:\n\n    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\n    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\n    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\n\n    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.\t XView is often said to be\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\n\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\n    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.\n\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\n    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\n    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\n\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\n\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\n    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\n    is being developed by OSF.\tIt has a `look and feel' reminiscent of\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.\tAlthough Motif is currently available on\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\n    large installed base.\n    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\n    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.\n\n@ What is MoOLIT?\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\n    Release 4.2.\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\n\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\n    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\n    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\n    available, however)\n\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\n\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\n    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.\n\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\n    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\n\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the\n    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\t You can\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\n    directory; there are three patches).\n\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\n\n    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\n    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run\n    under olwm.\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:\n\tLeftTitleButton \"target\" = f.delete\n    where \"target\" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.\n    Alternatively, try\n\t# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\n\tLeftTitleButton \":menu\" = f.menu \"OL.menu\"\n\n\tmenu \"OL.menu\" {\n\t    \"Quit\"         f.delete\n\t}\n\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\n\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\n\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\n\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\n    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes\n    pageview in particular.\n\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's\n    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.\n\n\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\n     \n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\n\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\n\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\n    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\n\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\n    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.\n\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\n\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's \"contool\" program so that\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\n\n    .Xdefaults\n\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,\n    it is a good idea to include at least:\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\ttrue\n\t*Input: TRUE\n    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they\n    forget to ask for it.\n\n    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default\n    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.\n    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.\n\n    .startup.ps\n\n    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)\n    on startup.\t This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the\n    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change\n    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a\n    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up\n    at all or will get broken in strange ways.\tThe NeWS manual gives code\n    that is both incorrect and insufficient.\n    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.\n\n    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see\n    the man page for xset (\"man xset\", and \"xset -help\") for more information.\n\n    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of\n    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of\n    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for\n    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime\n    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to\n    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your\n    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...\n\n\t% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual\n\t% /IncludeDemos? false def\n\n\tUserProfile begin\n\t    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...\n\tend\n\n    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:\n\n\t/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\n\tClassRepeatKeys pop\t% force repeat.ps to autoload\n\n\tendpackage endpackage endpackage\n\n    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the\n    OpenWindows server like this:\n\t$ psh -i .startup.ps\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send\n\t%%% now press control-D\n\n    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make\n    the root window be \"retained\", so that a PostScript drawing on the\n    background won't be erased when you move windows:\n\tframbuffer /Retained true put\n    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used\n    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.\n    \n    See also:\n\tTrouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type\n\tTrouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?\n\tEnvironment Variables\n\n@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?\n    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one\n    or two occasional surprises.  See also \"man 7 xview\" for a list of\n    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.\n\n    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings\n    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should\n    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this\n    in your .xinitrc:\n\n    if eval `svenv -env`\n    then\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3\"\n\tinput_from_defaults\n    else\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 3 2 1\"\n    fi\n\n\n@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?\n\n    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but\n    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.\n    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as\n    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system\n    run screenblank automatically.\n\nSubject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste\n\n@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?\n\n    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):\n    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button\n      in xterm\n    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly\n      XView manual gets this wrong)\n    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)\n\n    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste\n\n   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:\n    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY\n    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).\n    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.\n\n@ COPY/PASTE is boring.\t What short-cuts are available?\n\n    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:\n    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button\n    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined\n      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)\n    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.\n    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection\n    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-\n      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button\n    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse\n      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the\n      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).\n    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want\n      to drop the text\n    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show\n      that it's OK to drop things here\n    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.\tThis works in text fields of\n      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection\n    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that\n      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.\n\n@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?\n\n    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.\n    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when\n    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the\n    right of the insert point.\n\n\tMeta-i - include file\t    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)\n\n\tCtrl-a - start of line\t    Ctrl-< - back word\n\tCtrl-e - end of line\t    Ctrl-> - forward word\n\tCtrl-w - delete word\t    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line\n\tCtrl-Return - move to end/START of document\n\n    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default\n    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.\n\n@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?\t Where is it documented?\n\n    See the manual page for shelltool.\n\nSubject: Applications: Finding Out...\n    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,\n    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_\n    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.\n\n    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular\n    OPEN LOOK applications.

You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes\n    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache\n    parameters.\t If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the\n    font cache size.\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you\n\tcurrentfontmem =\t% type this line ...\n\t300\t% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes\n\t1024 setfontmem\n\t% Just to check:\n\tcurrentfontmem =\n\t1024\n    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.

It\n\twill monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a\n\tmessage appears; it's very easy to configure.\n\n    If \"refresh\" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages,\n    go away...\n\ta Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the\n\tmouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto\n\ta whole new (but monochrome) display, called \":0.1\".  See the man.\n\tpage for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and,\n\tif there's a /dev/cgfour0, does\n\t\topenwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0\n\tIf you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this\n\tto your .xinitrc or other startup file:\n\t(\n\t    eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env`\n\t    olvwm -display unix:0.1\n\t) &\n\tLater releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically.\n\tYou can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see\n\tthe note about contool, above.\n\n@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?\n    Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.\n    This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your\n    .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.\n    Keep comments by using \"comment.\" instead of \"!\", for example,\n\tcomment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37\n\n@ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit?\n    set the default editor to\n\tsh -c \"exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \\\"$FILE\\\"\"\n    (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)\n\n@ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video?\n    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.\t With OpwnWindows 3.0,\n    there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're\n    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of\n    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.\n\n@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?\n    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.\n    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output\n    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.\n    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're\n    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;\n    the new one is fantastic!\n\n@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays\n  on the screen.\n    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in\n    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').\n\n@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.\n    This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to\n    use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.\n    \n@ Why have some of my function keys stopped working?\n    Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37\n    respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you\n    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to\n    change your keyboard layout back again.\n\n@ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version\n    See under \"Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages\" below.\n\n    (see also next item)\n\n@ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows\n    (see also next item)\n\n    Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch\n    level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to\n    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with\n    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.\n\n    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.\tYou can intermix OpenWindows\n    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.\n    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.\n\n    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions\n    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a\n    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory\n    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have\n    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in\n    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead\n    of OpenWindows ones!\n\n    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11\n    library directory.\tThis doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with\n    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't\n    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although\n    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.\n\n    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't\n    /usr/openwin.\n\n    See Also:\n\tEnvironment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).\n\n@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found\n    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use\n\t     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib\n    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use\n    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for\n    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.\n\n@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero\n    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches\n    and install the patch.\n\n@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?\n    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.\tIt won't run under\n    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw\n    the PostScript text and pictures.\n    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0\n    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.\n    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace\n    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to\n    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)\n    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.\n    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with\n    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).\n\n@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?\n    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from\n    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z\n\n@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?\n    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties\n    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.\n\n@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool\n    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also\n    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.\n    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.\n\n@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!\n    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be\n    selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted\n    in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus.\n    To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:\n\t*traversalOn: off\n\t*TextEdit.traversalOn: on\n\t*TextField.traversalOn: on\n    You can change the color using (for example)\n\t*InputFocusColor: grey50\n\t*input*FocusColor: green\n\t*List*inputFocusColor: <your background color>\n    See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set\n    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.\n    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the\n    OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.\n\n@ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when\n  I move into a different window! (\"colormap flashing\")\n    \n    This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.\n    However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:\n    *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.\n    *  Run\n\tcmap_compact save\n       to create the .owcolors file\n    *  Put the line\n\tcmap_compact init\n       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)\n    *  Exit and then restart the window system.\n    *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of\n\tthe colormap and reserves them.\n\n    Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and\n    Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.\n\n@ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):\n    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif\n    window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.\n    Try running pageview like this:\n\t$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono\n\t$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview\n\t$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard\n\n@ XDM breaks things\n    Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'.\n    Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.\n    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in\n\tsvenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic\n    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.\n    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security\n    hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your\n    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...\n\n@ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working\n    In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names (\"keysyms\") for these keys was changed\n    to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.\t Code which uses them should be recompiled,\n    or you might be able to get away with\n\txmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36'\n\nSubject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems\n    This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears, which has been\n    promised, but hasn't reached here.\tNote that there is also a usenet\n    newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very\n    wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles\n    per month.\tYou should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x.\n\n@ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items?\n    PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle.\n    PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.\n    There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.\n    You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you\n    insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function\n    insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits.\n\n@ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed?\n    In the button callback, do\n        xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL);\n    This will keep the window visible.\n    You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute.\n\n@ how do I make an XView button look pressed?\n    call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are\n    documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source...\n\n@ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly\n    Here is Greg Earle's patch, to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you\n    should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and\n    OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2, for example).\n    I have edited the patch a little, so any bugs are mine [lee@sq.com] :-)\n \n*** bin/xmkmf.orig\tWed Sep 18 07:02:02 1991\n--- bin/xmkmf\tTue Aug  6 00:39:20 1991\n***************\n*** 30,34 ****\n  \n  elif [ -n \"$OPENWINHOME\" ]; then\n!

Remember\n: those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5\" floppies? These drives\n: are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb\n: disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the\n: prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently\n: not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to\n: develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there\n: any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?\n\nCertainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a\ncheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP\n200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more\nexpensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.\n\nA couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb\nflopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do\nthey need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy\ndrive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk\nand hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.\n\nOn the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a\nPCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing\noptical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a\nproduct themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format\nis a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is\nidentical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was\nquoted as saying that a 2.5\" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data\nthough he refused to comment on any possibility of this being\nproductized.\n\nThe article said that one of the problems holding back development in\nthis area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2\ndistinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it\nprobably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it\ninto the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it\nprobably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead\nto get MDs accepted.\n\n--\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndavid shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625\n                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq\n\t\t\"They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax,\n\t\t and they won't like the council tax.\"   - Nicholas Ridley   \n"}

For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). \n\nDear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993\n\nNumber 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you \nwill receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\ninto the discourse.\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\narea in question.\n   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,\nyou will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\nour common interest and job.\n\nAt the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\nevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\nand on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give\nproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail\nand by other means.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAnton P. \"Zeleznikar\nEditor-in-chief\n"}

On a Sun, the FIRST found resource\nis used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the\nLAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do\nabout it?\n\nI have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I\ncan use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the\nresource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?\n\nThanks in advance for replying,\nMarcel.\n-- \n X   drs.

And while amazed\nat the lightness of it, I was kinda shocked at the flimsiness of the\nscreen. I'm sure it'd break real easy....\n>>\n>> (Sorry, but other than my Trinitron, everything else I've ever bought from\n>> Sony has failed. Why did I keep trying? Because I'm 'tupid.)\n>\n>Aw, c'mon.

Our neighbor works for Zeinth and hates\nit (always asks why we didn't buy Zeinth products). Nice guy\nnevertheless. We still have two working Sony Color Trinitrons from\n1972 and 1974. Older one is on it's second picture tube, but both\nwork. Now they're relegated to the old 8-bit atari computer and atari\n2600 game machinces, as well as our not-that-old younger sister's\nNintendo game machine. Sony doesn't make TV's like they used to\nthough, the newer Mexican assembly-line TV's are not that reliable or\nsharp anymore... Dad also just got a 35\" direct-view Sony (god, the\nthing weighs a ton!). :)  Still, where would we be without Trinitrons,\nCD players, or the veritable Walkman????\n\n-shishin \"squish\" yamada\nsquish@endor.harvard.edu \n\n"}

I've been \nfiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do \nsome work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might \nnot - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to \n2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. \n\nThe most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a \nrather important font :-) \n\nI managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the \n[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't \nwork; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files \ngenerated the only font which appears there is Courier.

Please repost this CFV to any\nnewsgroup, listserver or reflector that you think might have a\ngroup interested in this subject in order to reach as broad an\naudience as possible. Every vote counts, so make sure you register\nyours if you want these groups to be created.\n\n \nProposed Groups\n---------------\ncomp.publish.cdrom.hardware\ncomp.publish.cdrom.software\ncomp.publish.cdrom.multimedia\n \nStatus\n------\nUnmoderated.\n \n\nVoting Period\n-------------\nFrom: The appearance of this posting\nTo:   23:59 EST, 21 May 1993\n\nHow To Vote\n-----------\nAll votes must be emailed to: manaster@yu1.yu.edu\nor sent as a reply to the originator of this CFV (manaster@yu1.yu.edu). \n\n-To vote, simply copy the example below and delete either the \"Yes\"\nor the \"No\" before each group to register your vote for or against\nthe creation of that group. A line containing \"Yes/No\" as in the\nexample below, will be considered an abstention with respect to\nthat particular group. Note that each group will have its own\nseparate vote count and that you may split your vote for the groups\nor abstain as you will. Please provide your Name and E-mail address\nas shown in the example below.\n\n\t\tEmail your  vote following this\n\t\texample.....\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: Re: Vote on comp.publish.cdrom.*\n\t\nI  vote \"Yes/No\" for the creation of \"comp.publish.cdrom.software\"\nI  vote \"Yes/No\" for the creation of \"comp.publish.cdrom.hardware\"\nI  vote \"Yes/No\" for the creation of \"comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia\"\n\n\t[Last Name], [First Name] [(E-mail Address)]\n\t.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVoting Rules\n------------\n-Only one vote per user (Two different people cannot vote under the\n same user name).\n-Any votes which are received before or after the voting period\n will be discarded.\n-Anyone who wants to change their previous vote may do so by voting\n again.  They must indicate that they have previously voted and are\n changing their mind in a footnote.  A changed vote will discard your\n previous vote.\n-Email messages sent to the above addresses must constitute unambiguous\n and unconditional votes for/against newsgroup creation as proposed.\n Conditional votes will not be accepted.\n-Only votes emailed to the above addresses will be counted; mailed\n replies to this posting will be discarded.\n-In the event that more than one vote is placed by an individual, only\n the first vote will be counted unless it was changed as above.\n-No information will be supplied as to how people are voting until the\n final acknowledgment is made at the end, at which time the full vote\n will be made public.\n\nAmbiguous Votes\n---------------\nAmbiguous votes -- those who do not follow the specified format, or \ndo not make clear the voter's intent, will, where possible,  be \nreturned to their senders for clarification.  Ambiguous votes which \ncannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is \nprovided will be identified in the final vote tally.\n\nEvery Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!!\n\n\nRationale\n---------\nThe rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or\ninvolved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for\nthe discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora\nfor such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither\nof which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the\ngeneral cdrom community with focuses on library, government and\nnetwork usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted \nto publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,\nand ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.\n \nThe reason for the division into three groups is a natural\npartition of interest between the hardware and software topics,\nand between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext\nand multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, \nPhoto CD and other related formats would be included as well. \nTopics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly\nhardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and\nother legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in\nthe purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other\nnonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom\npublishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as\nindex and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom\nsimulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging\nsoftware, data capture software, data clean up, compression,\nencryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that\naids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and\nvideo.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that\nrelates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,\nsuch as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as\ninformation that publishers need to know about the hardware that\nthe intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will\neventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.\n \nNotes\n-----\nThese groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or\nquestions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or\nquestions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.\nRequests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general\ntopics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms\nmounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.\n \nCharter\n-------\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tIndex and retrieval software\n \n\tAuthoring software\n \n\tScanning and imaging software\n \n\tOCR and OCR cleanup\n \n\tHypertext\n \n\tSGML\n \n\tPremastering and Simulation (cdrom) software\n \n\tCopyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms\n \n\tOther nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tCD-R equipment\n \n\tData capture hardware\n \n\tScanners\n \n\tVideo and audio capture hardware\n \n\tNetworking hardware\n \n\tMidi hardware\n \n\tPhoto CD hardware\n \n\tPublishing systems\n \n\tCDI and DVI hardware\n \n\tCompression and encryption hardware\n \n\tKeyboarding\n \n\tOther hardware publishing topics\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tMultimedia authoring software\n \n\tImaging software\n \n\tAudio and Midi software\n \n\tColor control software\n \n\tVideo editing software\n \n\tAudio editing software\n \n\tMultimedia utilities useful for publishers\n \n\tIntegration of text, image, audio and video\n \n\tCompression and encryption of multimedia\n \n\tMultimedia copyright and related legal issues\n \n\tMultimedia databases and hypertext\n \n\tOther multimedia publishing topics\n-- \n\tHenry Manaster          *     EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.edu\n\tBrooklyn, NY            *\n\tDisclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that \n\t\t\t\tof anyone else :-)  ????!\n"}

The floppys have their own processor on their controller\nboard which handles all of these commands.\n\nThe difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are\nintelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the\nCPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor\nto transfer their data.\n\n>>Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\n>>thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.

Most SCSI cards will\nalso DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore\nallowing it to continue working uninterupted.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n(for better or for worse).\n\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\na portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\nframes.\n\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\nfor the results I'd been reporting earlier.\n\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\nThat's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\naction, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\nease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\nswitching.\n\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\neven more...\n\nLawrence D'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47' 26\" S, 175^ 19' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\n"}

Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds\nto play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to\nthe channel also to let you know when the channel is getting\nempty.

I was doing continuous background sound with\ninterrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V\ndocumentation.\n\nYou probably were cancelling your callback commands out of\nyour channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\n\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\nit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you\ncan too.\n\nOne little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the\nSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not\nsure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your\nsounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the\nSound Manager.\n\n-Steve\n"}

{"group": "comp.os.ms-windows.misc", "text": "From: glazer@ohstpy.mps.ohio-state.edu\nSubject: Local Windows .vs. Shared Windows (Discussion)\nOrganization: The Ohio State University, Department of Physics\nLines: 110\n\nI would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows\nfrom a Novell administrator's point of view.\n \nI just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they\n(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,\nthe LOCAL setup (described below) as the \"most advantageous installation\".\nIf this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation\nthen I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.\n \nThe LOCAL Windows Installation:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWindows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the\nresources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation,\nhe/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.\nThen install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network\nto install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers\nare available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.\n \nAdvantages:\n- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to\n  the local access of main Windows files.\n- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point\n  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing\n  and reduce the cost of down-time.\n- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard\n  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network\n  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster\n  access than local ones.\n- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about\n  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the\n  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk\n  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can\n  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.\n- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to\nadminister.\n  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of\n  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.\n- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system\n  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for\n  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.\n- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup\n  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.\n  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be\n  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable\n  applications and *not* user data.\n \nThe SHARED Windows Installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWindows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure\ndescribed above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of\nfiles to individual \"user\" directories.  These directories may be on a\nlocal hard disk or perhaps a network \"home\" directory.  The bulk of the\nWindows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory\n(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout\ntheir Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files\nthat the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include\ngroup files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.\n \nAdvantages:\n- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As\n  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this\n  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.\n- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,\n  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct\n  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.\n- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files\n  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with\n  all driver updates.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network\n  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the\n  speed of Windows.\n- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's\n  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs\n  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will\n  usually not be able to save their work.\n- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files\n  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a\n  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows\n  files alone.\n- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation\n  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being\n  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).\n  \nThe Discussion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows\nuserbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have\nsetup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and\napplication files are on the network with little or no utilization of\nlocal hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the\ncompany would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations\nand thus save that much more money.\n \nI would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should\napps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how\nWindows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy\nbackup and administration but this is \"putting all eggs in one basket\";\nif the network crashes, work comes to a halt.\n \nNow I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own\nideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to\nhear from people with \"actual\" working experience with users and network\nadministration.\n \n\n"}

IMHO the wider meaning is not\n:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to\n:  be!  [....]\n\n:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody\n:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very\n:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know\n:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]\n\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\n\nI, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\n\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX\n     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password\n     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.\n\n     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\n\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\n     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\n\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\n\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\n     project.\n\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\n     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\n\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\n     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.\n\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\n\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\nworkplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\n\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\n\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\nto communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,\nthen language is working.\n\n--\n|================= #include <stddisclaimer.h> ================///=============|\n| \"AMIGA: The computer for the creative mind\" (tm) Commodore /// Weber State  |\n| \"Macintosh: The computer for the rest of us\"(tm) Apple \\\\\\///   University  |\n|== \"I think, therefore I AMiga\" -- val@csulx.weber.edu ==\\///= Ogden UT USA =|\n"}

Unfortunately substituting\nXmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable\nalternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)\n\nI have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone\nwants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not\nproperly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the\nsource to look at it is just a guess.\n\nPlease let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,\nor if you want the sample program.\n\nTHANKS!!!!!!!!\n\n- Susan \n\n  swalker@bbn.com\n  617-873-8190\n\n"}

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and\nLightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional\nphoto-realistic images for a variety of purposes.\n\n-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --\n\nThis mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how\nit operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images\navailable to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and\nLightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the\npackage.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as\na group.\n\n-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --\n\nSince LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster\nsoftware, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation\nof the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving\nspecifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.\n\nYou do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!\n\n-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --\n\nTo become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail\nmessage to the address:\n\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nIn the body of the message enter:\n\nsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain\n\nOr just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this\npoint in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated\nscript based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a\ndelay in joining.  Expect a \"welcome\" message within 5 days after you\nsend your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!\n\n-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --\n\nContributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the\nfollowing address:\n\n        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nYour article will be processed by the system and distributed to all\nothers joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so\nyou know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those\naddresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back\nto you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no\nlonger valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This\ndoesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the\nopposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it\ncouldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad\naddress.\n\nNOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.\n\n-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --\n\nSimply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address\nyou used to sign up:\n\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nIn the body of the message enter:\n\nunsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain\n\nI will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join\nthe list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be\nable to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the\nlist!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send\na request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend\nforwarding of the articles to you.\n\n\n-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --\n\nI am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the\noriginating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due\nto lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a\ncompendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store\nthem in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an\nindex of the contents of the compendium and any other information that\nrelates.\n\nIf there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI\nhard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>\n\nI have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the\nlist can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past\narticles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to\nthe LightWave3D mailing list.

To\nrecapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor\nmomentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an\neighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right\nafter I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that\nradically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens\nwith no provocation whatsoever.\n\nI have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was\na man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the\nproblem was that the 13\" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always\nkeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from\na largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's\npower supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was\nreally wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that\nit had to be endured.)\n\nThis seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to\nadopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13\" monitor\nowner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the \nApple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading\nJitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement\nof a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,\nthe swap of a circuit board.\n\nI would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had\nexperience with this sort of thing.\n\n"}

Normal {asynchronous}\n SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these\n modes is mainly in the software drivers.\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. \n Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for\n a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.\n 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using\n SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which\n results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit\n and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software\n drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI\n interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term\n 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},\n 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit}.\n\n8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 \nthat I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software\ncontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds\nfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT\nNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit\nSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1\nelectornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider\n16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but\n4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1\nbut is 8-bit SCSI-2.\nRule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.\n\n8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost\ncompared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.\n"}

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel\nof 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.\n\nPerhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to\nrepresent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.\n\nMost likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)\nframe buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture\nto be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous\nframe) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.\n\n>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)\n\nWell hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+\ncard with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24\nbit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.\n\nMind you the card costs more than your workstation.\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at\nthat res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)\nissue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in\nimage quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any\ndifference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one\nof the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's\nExtremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.\nBut many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a\nbunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim \"low\nemissions\" but not specifically \"MPR-II Compliant\" or \"MPR-II Certified\"\nonly control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.\n\tSo, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-\ntently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low\nemissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you\nmay be more discerning.

What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time\nthe video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the\nMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video\ncircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,\neven pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's\npretty hard to hit menu items ;-)\nWe had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem\nhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has\nvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the\ncache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not\nobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU\nright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did\nnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have\nhas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,\nbut did it twice within an hour yesterday).\nThe technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty\nsharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had\npreviously tried ourselves anyway). These included:\n-swapping the RAM\n-swapping the VRAM\n-swapping monitors (3 different 13\" Apple RGB and 2 16\" Apple RGB)\n-swapping cables\n-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy\n-sacrificing various small mammals\nHere are some other facts:\n-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed\n (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)\n-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards\n that exhibit it in our lab\n-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards\n that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as\n faulty according to us.\nHere are some speculations:\n-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that\n much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do\n with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can\n reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).\n-the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our\n walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We\n have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in\n the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do\n not want to believe it.\n-it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past\n security at the entrance to our site.\n\nHas anyone any ideas?

HELP!!!\nOrganization: Wittenberg University\nLines: 56\nNntp-Posting-Host: wittenberg.edu\n\nInteresting delema for all those out there.\nMy school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio\n100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the\ndeal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a\ndisection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow\ndrawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know\nNADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I\nwnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing\nlist?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.\nOk here it goes:\n\n\tWe are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms\noffered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price\nand reliability, the second being VERY important.\n\tHow much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you\nthink?\n\tOk, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard\n(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time\ngreat wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is\njust a reliable?  Price?\n\tPrinters:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the\nThermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit\naccess so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in\nterms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) \nPrice? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or\nsuch to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is\nthe Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. \nSuggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through\nand they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy\nto maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).\n\tFinally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting\nthese things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the\nnet, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be\nastronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask\nthem?\n\tLittle more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot\nabout macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the\ntime to go and look for all of this stuff. So I am hoping the collective\nresources and intelect of the net can help (Has before) [Shameless plug: BUY\nEMPOWER!!!

When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M\nharddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space \nwould cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-\nuartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and \nyou will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  \n\nParticularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a\nseveral-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files \nwith DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like \nos, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are \npricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much\nit would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a \nuseful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though\nI must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my \ncomputer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to \nbecause I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, \nsoftPC or trying any unix os!)\n\n-Peter\nbell@minerva.cis.yale.edu \n"}

Multiple graphs (of the same or\n  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n  \n  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\n  \n  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n  \n  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\n  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\n  \n  Authors: Many.

It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.

Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,\n   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\n   any specified angle.\no  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan\n   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to\n   region target mean, median, or modal value.\no  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,\n   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.\no  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of\n   region of an image.\no  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot\n   keyword values for a set of images.\no  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,\n   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower\n   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive\n   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical\n   aperture shape to image isophotes. \no  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot\n   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`\n   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,\n   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and\n   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function\n   or histogram equalization.\no  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for\n   registration.\no  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or\n   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers\n   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,\n   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and\n   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights\n   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass\n   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)\n   to file or printer.

I had it return random colours instead and everything worked great (except for a few colour problems) so I know its the only thing wrong.\n\nThe colour table somehow gets a couple of nulls placed in it so when the \"name\" of the colours are compared it crashes.

Nor did they particularly care to investigate.\n\nOK, here's my results so far....\n\n1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support\n   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)\n\n2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved\n   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.\n   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)\n\n3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.\n\nOK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC\nwhich will act as a universal sync decoder.\n\nI want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync\npulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting\nthe -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.\n\nThere are 2 reasons for doing this\n\n1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're\n   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.\n\n2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the\n   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my\n   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,\n   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.\n   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA\n   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,\n   I can get down to 1.\n\nUltimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,\nbut I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...\n\n\n\n--\nAlan Brown\ndogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz\n\n"}

I think\nin MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original\npost mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number\nof people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.\nI was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to\nlook at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.\n\nI also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call\nthem are highly technical. Look around in the real world people don't want\nto GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their \njob done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need \na computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and the\nmultitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does\nthis and does it WELL. We are running 150 pc's loaded with a complete\nsuite of mostly MS Windows applications in an administrative business\nfunction on a Novell network running all software off the server.\nIt does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick\nWindows again. \nAgain I repeat to MS keep doing what you are doing.

How restrictive it will be depends on \nwhat you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances\nof some really nasty program like \"Smoking Clover\" would make the link \nuseless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly\nupdating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real\nworld, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.\n\nGoing by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have\nto share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.\n\n>>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\n>>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\n>>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\n>>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\n>\n>Hmmm.

The usage patterns are not very\ngood predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth\nlinks that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they\noften use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database \nremotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always\nat this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview\nX and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having\na long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about\nhow you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.\n\nRunning Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.\nLet's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy\nand efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a\nlittle more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen\nthat was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server\nthat it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough\nmemory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network\ntraffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a \nsolid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite\neasily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send\nit back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw\nthat small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be \nrepainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits\nthat has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.\nIn reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts \nthat will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.\n\n>\n>\n>>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\n>>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\n>>doing network things also...)\n>>-- \n>\n>What do you mean by network things?

I am wondering how \n>good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these \n>images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.\n\nX was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's \npretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost\nas good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.\nWe intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver\nkeyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in\nno way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a \nlot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but\nwe are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications\ntell us.\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   |\n|         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\\  |\n|  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\\  |\n|   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\\  |\n|          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\\  |\n|    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\\  |\n|     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\\  |\n|         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n"}

Previously I\nhad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU\nbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.\n\nYour mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted\nbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.\nI didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher\nspeeds.\n\nParts\n\n\tClock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of\n\tspeeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the\n\toscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend\n\tgetting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.\n\n\t   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for\n\t   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:\n\n\t\t   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\n\t\t   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\n\t\t   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\n\n\t   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\n\n\t   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\n\t   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\n\t   \n\tSocket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\n\t   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\n\t   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\n\n\tCooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \n\t   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\n\t   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\n\t   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \n\t   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\n\t   \nProcedure\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\n\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\n\tthe back of the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\n\trear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\n\t\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\n\t\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\n\tPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\n\tmotherboard then comes directly out.\n\t\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\n\tmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\n\t\n\tVery carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\n\tthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\n\tyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\n\t\n\tI used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\n\tNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\n\ta multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\n\tproper care.\n\t\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\n\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\n\told clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\n\tsocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\n\t50 mhz clock.\n\t\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\n\t\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\n\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\n\t\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\n\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\n\tsomething is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\n\thandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\n\t\n\tHopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\n\treplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\n\tbe astounded. \n\t\n\tYou will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\n\ta particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\n\tmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\n\tmodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\n\tproblem.\n\t\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real\nrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than\n$50 in parts.\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\n"}

Its just  \nthat the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.  Multisession means that  \nwhen you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can  \nread and display them.

This means that you lose the ability to add  \nany more pictures after the first time (must buy a new CD).  Finally, since the  \nCD150 is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer  \ndata (excluding sound).\n\n> Michael M.

Think *very* carefully.\nUnless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want\nto trade elsewhere.\n\nDespite the fact that they answer the phone, \"Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're\nhaving a GREAT Day!\", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return\na modem that didn't work as I expected it to.\n\nThe details:\n\nI ordered one of their house brand \"Infotel\" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.\nIn reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over\nthe name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not\nhave ordered it, had I known this in advance.\n\nIt arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was\npreconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.\n\nFor several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the\ntime I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.\n\nAlthough the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or\n14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After\nspending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested\ndisabling the COM2 port.\n\nThis appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long\nterm solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both\nwould not be in use at the same time as the modem.\n\nI called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail \nhell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I \nwas then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they \ndidn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.\n\nI called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA\nnumber. She promptly switched me to a \"Tech Support\" rep that implied that\nit was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA\nnumber. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I\nwas not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does\nnot work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more \nthan the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local\ncharitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered\na Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.\n\nFor $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know \nwill support their users and sold by a company (based on personal\nexperience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have\nknown better...\n\n"}

Now, this is not so simple because some window managers\nslap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,\nso be sure to take that into account for further calculations.\n\nCalculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using\nXGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.\nRemember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the\nwindows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAll of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the\nwindow-manager is using.\n\nNow, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate \nwhere you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on\nthe OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).\n\nDISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.  But\nI did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free to\ncall or e-mail for further info.\n\n              -McGary\n\n-- \nMike D.

Usually it confines itself to not\ncopying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for\nediting in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.\n \nThe one nice thing it has, though, is it's \"dither\" option.  You'd think\nthat this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,\n256 colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W,\nyou can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which\nturn to white.

Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster\n>Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure\n>you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nRunning MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the\nfollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified\nexplanation.\n\nTechnically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer\nadapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that\n\"Something's happening here, please take note.\" How the CPU is\nprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.\nIn MS-DOS, the \"interrupt vector\" is used to store the address of the\nfunction that handles each interrupt.\n\nNow, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready\nto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When\nDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,\nwait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to\nthe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's\nfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. \n\nWith any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing\napproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU\ncycles.) Hence, you can't \"share\" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're\nrunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.\n\nAnother issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses\ninterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what\nto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is\nrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is\nneeded.\n\nYou can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use\nthem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine\nis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came\nfrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.\n\nRemember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the\ngeneral picture correctly enough.\n\nCheers,\n\n-- \n               Juha Liukkonen, aka jliukkon@cc.helsinki.fi\n              University of Helsinki,  Dept. of  Lost Souls\n           \"Trust me, I know what I'm doing.\" - Sledge Hammer\n"}

Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a\nbargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies\n(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime\nplayer in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign).

The Toshiba's speed\nadvantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)\nand 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).\n\nGood luck,\nMark\n"}

One is a C program that will perform a \"morph\" between\nany two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then\nit will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out\nto a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions\nand insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would\nlet me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply\nperforming incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary\nobject but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know\nan easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the\norigin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there \nmust be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because\nI had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new\npoint and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However\nthis occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is \nappreciated.\n\nttknock@bbs.santafe.edu\n\n"}

Although this is not intended to\nbe a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets\nfrom chemical research problems will be used in lab and students\nwill be encouraged to bring data sets of their own.

Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for\nthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as\nthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture\nquality if your dithering works right).\n\nI can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to\nGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.\nYou don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA\ncard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+\ncomputers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a\n8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write\nsome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other\ncolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg\ndithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette\nthe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would\nwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but\nit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way\ngives a brighter more detailed image.\n\nAnyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as\nfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the\nVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)\n\nHave a day!\n\nGerry.\n"}

Thus if you have compressed your\ndisk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being\nthe compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the\nuncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.

An update to the chipset may \nbegat an update to the motherboard board design.\n\nWhat I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this\noff as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT \nalong with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.\nIf I were you I would be cautious about this.\n\nYou might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA\nmotherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are\nVL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'\n32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive\nthan equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.\n\nLook in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-\nboard.

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as\npossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies\nprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that\nsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24\nmachines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.\nThis is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this poll. \n\n\nIssues:\n\n\tSpeed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without\n\t\tadd on cards. All reported machines were able to use\n\t\t25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple\n\t\tNubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter\n\t\twas able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to\n\t\tachieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place\n\t\n\t\tAt speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and\n\t\thi density floppy disk problems have been reported.\n\t\t\n\t\tNote: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not\n\t\t\ttested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,\n\t\t\tthe 25 mhz operational machines may well work at\n\t\t\thigher speeds.\n\t\t\t\n\tDamage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was\n\t\trepaired and the machine is operational. One other\n\t\treported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator\n\t\tduring desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user\n\t\tputting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.\n\t\t\n\t\tNo reports of static discharge damage.\n\t\t\n\t\tNo reports of high speed operation causing damage.\n\t\t\n\t\tThen again, I also don't have any reports from users of\n\t\tdefective parachutes.\n\t\t\n\tAdd on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus\n\t\tAdapters. Several other add on boards have been used with\n\t\tsuccess. See case histories\n\t\t\n\tHeat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.\n\t\tThese were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some\n\t\tused epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab\n\t\tof cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a\n\t\tbolt through the hole in the motherboard.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nCase Histories:\t\n\nAll speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator).

You can use any\nold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a\nMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two\nmachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a\nthree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.\n\n    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.\n The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400\nresolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\n1604s).\n\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would\nadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As\nto the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because\nthey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.\n    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN\nCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU\nTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND\nTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.\n\npersonal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers\ndoesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. \"well you can get a resolution\n1168x832 on this $5,  9\" \"super smelly sock\" monitor that will let you\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably\npriced \"oder eater\" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an\nultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz\nvertical.\")\n\n\n\nNote:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video\nboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the\nsides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as\npossible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an\ninch.\n\n                                                                    -A.\n"}

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8\nbits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This\ncolour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these\nmodifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped\nto this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a\n32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. \nHaving done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?\n\nApply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to\neach colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range\n0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth\ncolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.\n\nYou could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how\nfar each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look\nrather odd.\n\nSo in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:\n\n>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file?

If\nthat was not what you meant, then:\n\n>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many\n>places so far.)\n\nYes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting\nmade it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \nPlug and Play on every PC.\n\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\nplatform use of the same device.\n\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\n=====================================\n\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \nfee or royalty.\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\n\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \nsynchronization.  \n\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\n\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \nreceiver.  \n\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \nadditional semantics, including checksum.\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \nsystem is running, without rebooting.\n\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\n\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\n\n\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\n------------------------------------------------\nPostal Address:\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\nFax: (408) 991-3773\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\n\n"}

Windows NT (tm)\nis becomming usable.\n\nThere are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.\nFirst (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.\nWhat I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other\nresourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  \nAnd my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone\nknows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), \nplease let me know.\n\nThe second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.\nFor instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster\n(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't \nproduced drivers yet.\n\nYour disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and\ngive the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever\nyou wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into\nWindows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.\n\nWindows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows\nthough.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should\nreally have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work\nwell enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never\nheard of anyone else who did either.\n\nIt's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the\nbox, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity.\n\nI guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint\nof heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta.\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Scott Reimert  \\    reimert@mamacass.etdesg.trw.com     /Standard disclaimer:\nRedondo Beach, CA \\______________________________________/\"Blah blah blah ... \"\n__________________|Always store beer in a cool dark place|_____________________\n"}

Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two\n disks at once.  Duplexing, which is the preferred way of mirroring, uses\n two controller cards and two disk drives.  Duplexing requires a special\n card and two identical disk drives (in most cases).

However, the\n OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different\n version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error.  Make sure\n that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the\n NetWare installation set.\n\n WM> 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives,\n WM> one of which has failed?\n\n Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I, or one volume\n mirrored using SFT II.  Impossible to tell with the network being down.\n\n WM> 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it\n WM> will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive?\n\n Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and\n installing the software as one volume under SFT I.  If the software will\n install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work\n in this configuration.\n\n WM> 4.

The second part is \n  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about\n  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in\n  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\n  sections of this document  before posting. \n  \n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\n  part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\n  of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically \n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where\n  \"name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\n  subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.   \n\n    \n\n ==================== \n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\n ====================\n  \n       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is \n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \n  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \n  \n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\n  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\n  news.announce.newusers.\n\n\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \n     \n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\n  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\n  \"-faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\n  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when\n   you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\n  before sending it to you. \n  \n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\n  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. \n  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\n  where. \n  \n         To jump to a particular question search for\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\n  example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for\n  the string  \"(2.1)\".  To jump to a section instead of a question\n  use a zero for  the question number.\n\n\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\n\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and \n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\n  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX\n  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\n  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n\n\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\n  \n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \n  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\n  ways of  communicating.  \n  \n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\n  network software designers.\n  \n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \n  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\n  catch-all newsgroup.\n  \n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\n  \n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \n  \n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\n  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\n    \n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\n  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\n  \n         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\n  comp.sys.mac.\n\n\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\n\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\n  for answering common questions like this one.\n   \n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\n  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\n  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\n  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\n\n    \n\n === \n FTP  (2.0) \n ===\n\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\n\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\n  should be available at the above sites.\n  \n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n  (130.69.254.254). \n\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \n  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\n  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\n  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\n  material you find here.\n\n\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\n\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\n  words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\n  message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).\n\n\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\n\n      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\" \n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\"\n  (no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what\n  you're looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions. \n  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\n  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with \"prog\n  Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\n  erroneous matches add a \".*\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g.\n  \"prog disi.*\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \n\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\n\n\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\n\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\n\n\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\n\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\n  protocol.\n  \n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\n  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\n  files as they are downloaded.\n\n***************************************************************************\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \nExtractors\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \nCompact Pro|         X     X \nPackit     |                           X\nUUTool     |                                                      X \nMacCompress|                                X \nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \nBinHex 4.0 |               X \nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \nUnZip      |                                                   X \nDiskCopy   |                                     X \nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\n***************************************************************************\n\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\n\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\n  compression schemes.

Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\n  Expander. \n    \n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\n   \n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\n  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\n  available by anonymous ftp. \n  \n         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\n  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress\n  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\n  info-mac/unix directory.\n\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\n\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\n  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.\n  \n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\n  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\n  \n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above\n  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\n\n\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\n\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a\n  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\n  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.\n    \n         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \n  \n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that \n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \n  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then\n  \"get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course\n  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\n  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\n  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\n  \n  \n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\n\n       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \n  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement \n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going \n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \n  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send \n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \n  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\n================================================================= \n\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. \n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\n  recommend solutions to you.\n\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\n\n      \"Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn't say much.  What were you\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \n  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is\n  not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\n  contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\n  problem and see if it's still there or not.\n\n\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\n\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\n  familiar.\n\n\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\n\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \n   \n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\n  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \n\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\n  reinstall. \n  \n         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these\n  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\n  program.  So it's time to\n\n\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \n \n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\n  cause of a system or application crash:\n  \n     a.\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \n     the crash.\n     \n     b.\tIf you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \n     when performing complicated operations.\n     \n     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\n     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\n     software out there including some from companies that really \n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\n     \n     d.\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\n\n\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\n\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\n  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\n\n    \n\n ====================== \n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\n ======================\n\n      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's\n  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step\n  program should be performed about every three months. \n\n\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\n\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,\n  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\n  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \n  the trash.\n\n\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\n\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \n  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \n\n\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\n\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \n  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than\n  to defeat an incumbent. \n  \n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\n  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\n  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \n  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \n  \n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \n  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\n  the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\" \n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\n  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\n   \n          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\n  corrupt data structures.    \n\n\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\n\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter\n  RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\n  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\n   \n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\n  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\n\n\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \n\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\n  \n         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6\n  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\n  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\n\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\n  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:\n\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \n        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or \n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \n        of the System Folder.\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \n        is  fine.\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't \n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \n        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you \n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace \n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \n        system overall.\n\n\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\n\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\n  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\n     \n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\n  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\n   \n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\n  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and\n  reformat (4.9).\n\n\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\n\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\n  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \n  \n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\n  \n         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\n  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\n  Backup from System 6.  \n\n\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\n\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\n  \n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\n  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\n   \n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\n  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the\n  net by asking for one. \n\n\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\n\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.\n     \n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \n  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\n  your hard disk.\n  \n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.

There is no way to boot from the\n  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.\n\n* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),\n  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI\n  drive.

Will there be a noticable\n>     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate?\n\n     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers\ngenerally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher\nthroughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk\n($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a\ngood SCSI controller.\n\n     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're\nused with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).\nUnfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking\noperating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is\nmostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to\nconnect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.\nHowever, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.\n\n     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's\ncheaper, and you'll have less headaches.\n\n> 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my\n>     hard-drive (bernoulli box, CD-rom, Tape Drive, etc).\n\n[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what\n  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]\n\n     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,\nwhich probably don't exist unless you're using one of the \"better\"/\"high\nperformance\" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI\ncontrollers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and\ndrivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular\nname-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased\n(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:\n\n* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI\n  controllers.\n\n* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).\n  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card\n  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.\n\n     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape\ndrives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it\nworks only with Adaptec controllers.\n\n> 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a\n>     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar\n>     equipment.\n\n     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a\nhigh-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound\nright, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,\nyou'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound\ncards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and\nWindows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI\ncontroller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape\nbackups).  If you want a copy of my \"Adaptec 1542 hints and tips\" file,\nsend email.\n\n     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;\nthe problems are really with the general hardware and software design of\nthe PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card\nis what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.\n\n     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC\ncompatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows\n3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll\nhave to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than\none SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the\npossible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, \"probably\", because,\nwhile I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really\nwill be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know\nfor sure.  ]\n"}

Jordan implemented the system\ndependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,\ncall it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include\nfile for your specific machine or operating system using the basic\nimplementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a \nOS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to\nreally implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically\nfor just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file\ntty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all\nit still is probably better to implement a include file for each and\nevery operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type\nof mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm\nsources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a \ncouple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the \n\"drivers\" actually included from the toplevel include file will be \ncompiled into emu.\n\nIt shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully\nrelies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux\nsystem available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest\nyou read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or\nquestions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately\nwe have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we \njust don't have access to that many different systems.\n\nMichael\n\n\n--\nMichael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.com\nIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - Mia\nFermentation fault (coors dumped)\n"}

I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero\nfootprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the\nfront panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in my\nSE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs\nholding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel\nwas coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation\nuntil it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a\nnetwork shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me\nsome dead time during which to have the drive sent out).\n\nI called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the\ntab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --\nthough nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my\nmodem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm\nnever flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I\ncould send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem\nwith that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a\nday (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under\nwarranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class\ninsured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed\nEx by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was\ntraveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).\n\nThe only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked\nto, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the\ndrive mechanism out and send just the case.

This I appreciated very\nmuch . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO \ninformation out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics\nprogrammer. The subjects are\n\n\t1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I\nknow somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to\ndothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books\nand info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a\nway to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in\nassembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get\nany speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?\n\n\t2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what\nthe net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of\nthe advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will\ntell me in \"mostly plain\" english how the vesa calls work.\n\n\tMy biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,\nI have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both\ngopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is\nsome lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of\nprogrammiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling\nyou how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I\nknow there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where\nare you, and why haven't you written a book yet? \n\nPlease help\n\nThanks in advance\n\nStephen palm\npalm@snycanva.bitnet\n(please send all personal replies to the above address, thanks)\n\n"}

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \nstandards.\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, \nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \nalso offering this card in the \"TurboBahn\" combination packaged \nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \nvalue.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins \nare available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.\n        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of \ngraphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for \nIBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two \nyear limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are \ncurrently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, \nresellers, VARs and systems integrators.\n        For more information contact Joe Brunoli, Marketing \nManager, Genoa Systems at 75 E.

I had gotten an advertisement for it and put \nit aside \nwith my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. \nNo part of \nthe software would load even though the install went seemingly well.\n\n\tI called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty \nmillion different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of \nthe \nsystems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're \nwilling to \ngive me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their \nsupport line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings \nof \nWindows 3.1. \n\tAfter my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned \nsome of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop \nAnimator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of \n\n.dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > \n100K the \nother dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied \n\nwith Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll  \nto a \ndirectory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll \nin my \nWindows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\\system directory.) \nWhen I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the \napplications in the package.. the main application still didn't load.

The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!\n\nFor example:\n\n\tSIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same\n\tthing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the\n\tannual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,\n\twhich means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the\n\tproceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.\n\n\tTOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.\n\n\tBasic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI\n\tmembership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,\n\tthese are now an extra cost option.

But their recommended\nchanges to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%\nincrease in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%\ninflation rate on the publications I got last year.\n\nIs anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am?\n________________________________________________________________________________\nRobert Reed\t\t\tHome Animation Ltd.\t\t503-656-8414\nrobert@slipknot.rain.com\t5686 First Court, West Linn, OR 97068\n\nSHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS\n\nMotif:  You spend days writing a UIL description of your foot, the\n  trajectory, the bullet, and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles\n  of the gun.

You even get blinking text - ok, enough\nadvertising.\n\nI haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories\nI have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do\nwhat we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since\nxterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to\nX10).\n\nThe actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you\nprovide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the\ncursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.\nSince it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you \ndo anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just\nhave to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after\nit's mapped.\n\nAs for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export\nis still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new\nrelease for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.\nBut since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say\nwhoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.\n\nAs is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else \nthan a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line\nof code). I'll put this on export today.\n\nMichael\n--\nMichael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.com\nIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - Mia\nFermentation fault (coors dumped)\n"}

I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the\npowerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a\ndifference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus\nany other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed\nby apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.\n\nI also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem\nallowing speeds just as any other serial port.\n\nMy particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to\ninterface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. \nCurrently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything\nup just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up.\n\nCan anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.  \nI would prefer email since I don't read the news at all.\nI will post a summary if enough response is generated.\n\nThanks. \n\nFaisal M. Bhamani\nfaceman@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu\n\nps. If this topic has been discussed already, please excuse me and\ndirect me to the appropriate places. thanks.\n"}

Here's my question:\n\nCONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the\n         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my\n         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it\n         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone\n         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that\n         I type \"telnet uicvm\" or \"tn3270 uicvm\" (either will work) at the DOS\n         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then\n         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon\n         screen. \"TELNET\" and \"TN3270\" are the names of batch files in my SLIP\n         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the\n         session.\n\nPROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I\n         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I\n         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that\n         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me\n         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to\n         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)\n         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP\n         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP\n         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-\n         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when\n         that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often\n         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center\n         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to\n         them with more questions.\n\nQUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows\n         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too\n         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that\n         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost\n         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:\n\n         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1\n         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation\n         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the\n            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp\n            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about\n            that.\n\n         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true\n         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under\n         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently\n         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet\n         session and other applications.\n\nAny information received is appreciated.\n\nPankaj Saxena\nu09416@uicvm.uic.edu\n"}

That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to \"\nAlways\" unless they know what password you used.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles\n=========================================\n\n First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP\nlist above.\n\n24-bit scanning:\n----------------\n  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for\n  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :\n  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll\n  house supplies.\n  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have\n  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.\n\nBooks with textures:\n--------------------\n  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.\n  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also\n  a wide variety of stock art is available.\n  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,\n  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.\n\n  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books\n  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your\n  graphics work.

Introduction to rendering algorithms\n========================================\n\na. Ray-Tracing:\n---------------\n\n  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read\n  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would\n  suggest:\n   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press\n     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4\n  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong\n  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines\n  (erich@eye.com)\n\nThere's a more concise reference also:\n\n  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\", in\n  \"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,\n  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.\n\nIt contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.\n\nb. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)\n--------------------------\n\nA good reference is:\n\n        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,\n        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.\n\nc.

Where can I find the geometric data for the:\n================================================\n\na. Teapot ?\n-----------\n\n\"Displays on Display\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole\nstory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has\nthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe\nmodel of the teapot.\n\nIEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \"Jim Blinn's Corner\" describes\nan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for\nexample are used.\n\nThe OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get\nthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He\nsaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.\n\nmodel2:\nThe newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles' model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor\nScott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.\n\n========================================================================\n\n16. Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based\n  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and\n  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based\n  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,\n  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed\n  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation\n  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).\n  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for\n  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.\n\n  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not\n  be redistributed without permission.\n\n  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that\n  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of\n  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging\n  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.\n\ng. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the \n  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen \n  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many\n  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as\n  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest\n  X11 archive.\n\n========================================================================\n\n17.

Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it\"\n\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\n\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing\n-- \nNick (Nikolaos) Fotis         National Technical Univ. of Athens, Greece\nHOME: 16 Esperidon St.,       InterNet : nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr\n      Halandri, GR - 152 32   UUCP:    mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis\n      Athens, GREECE          FAX: (+30 1) 77 84 578\n"}

The fastest\nones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They\ncan attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data\nrates you need more than SCSI for connections.

They are also not\nidle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a\nsmall company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces.

To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to\nthe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its\napplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the\ninternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory\n./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5\" diskette can be\nordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address\nbelow. \n\nThe base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the\nsame host.\n\nNote that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows\nAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.\n\n-----------\n\nThe Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment\non top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media\napplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the\ncapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that\nnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but\nalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,\nequations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can\nthemselves contain other objects, including text.\n\nAUIS has three components:\n\n    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set\n    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help\n    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell\n    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various\n    available types of objects. \n\n    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented\n    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein\n    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,\n    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as\n    easily as those that come with the system. \n\n    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface\n    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail\n    management strategies and implements many advanced  features\n    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of\n    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails\n    of related messages, and subscription management. It also\n    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and\n    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function\n    workstations. \n\nThe current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for\nthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards\nfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of\nthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new\neditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.\n\n\nRemote Andrew Demo Service\n\nYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew\nDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11\nwindow system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate\nthrough the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System\nto browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and\nnewsgroups.\n\nTo get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the\nfollowing command on your machine:\n\n\tfinger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu\n\nThe service will give you further instructions.   \n\n\nMore information about Andrew is available from:\n\n    Information Requests\n    Andrew Consortium\n    Carnegie Mellon University\n    Smith Hall 106\n    5000 Forbes Avenue\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n    USA\n    phone: +1-412-268-6710\n    fax: +1-412-682-6938\n    info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu\n\nContact info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu for additional information.  \n\n"}

Thanks.\n\nI get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to\ndeal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).\n\nHere is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.\n\nThis might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.\n\n\tGraeme Gill.\n\n###########################################################################\n\"A note on gamma correction and images\"\n\nAuthor: Graeme W. Gill\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\n\nDate: 93/5/16\n\n\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\n--------------------------------------\n\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded\nimages from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\n(or the lack of it).\n\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\n--------------------------------------\n\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\nsomething like this:\n\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\n\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\n\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\n\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\n\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\nimages with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\n\nWhose fault is all this ?\n-----------------------\n\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\nout there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is\nthat most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or\ndon't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\ngamma's.\n\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\n\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\n\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\nin the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\nto give a tint to the image. ]\n\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\nbit.)\n\nIf your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\nwill be above the center.\n\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\naround 2.2 \n\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\n-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\n\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\nto some degree or other.\n\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\n\nIf your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\n\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\nimages at the popular level.\n\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\n\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\n\n###########################################################################\n\n\n"}

My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable\n: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\n: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \n: the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\n: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\n: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\n: in the cable to align these.  \n\nMost IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed\ncircuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But\nbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables\nwith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors\nthis doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\nwhich side is pin 1.\n\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\n: and which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\n\nIt doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the\ndrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper\nselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the \ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't\nhave convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice\nhelp.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be\nable to help you).\n\nGood Luck\n\nGordon Lang\n"}

Also, undo of undo is\n    supported.\n\nThere is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)\n\n                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFor those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of\nwhat it is all about:\n\naXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant\nimprovement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it\nfeatures, amongst other things,\n\n   o multiple windows\n   o multiple buffers\n   o default menu interface\n   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons \n     under user control\n   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters\n   o provision for defining a keyboard macro\n   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters\n   o file selection via a browser\n   o knowledge of line numbers\n   o parenthesis matching\n   o regular expression searching\n   o restricted or unlimited undo\n   o ability to change font\n   o easy entry of control codes\n   o xterm-like keymap feature\n   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)\n   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help\n   o server mode with cooperating client programs\n   o optional extension language using Tcl\n   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability\n   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe\n\nI have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and\nXaw3d options, on the following systems:\n\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5\n   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5\n   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5\n   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5\n   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5\n   \nbut not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have\nonly tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.\n\nA number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been\nincorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is\nprovided for those systems that do not have one.\n\nAlthough aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been\nencountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under\nR4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known\nproblems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If\nit doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,\n2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as\nmany features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only\nthat, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of\naXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2\nnever got converted to make use of it.\n\naXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)\nand arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due\ncourse from several other ftp sites.

After a day or two of work I often find myself down under\n    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than\n    my shell running.\n\n    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some\n    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  \n\n    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are\n    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at\n    plugging this leak?\n\n    2.

Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a\n    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.\n\n    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was\n    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different\n    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)\n\n    5.

Actual measurements\n(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to\n20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is\nfiltered by the window manager as well as the applications and how\nmany processes are needed for each character.)\n\nWhile a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking\nprocess, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like\n10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase\nin overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working\nset.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many\nas 50.\n\nIf you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!\n\n\nNick Maclaren\nUniversity of Cambridge Computer Laboratory,\nNew Museums Site, Pembroke Street,\nCambridge CB2 3QG, England.\nEmail:  nmm1@cus.cam.ac.uk\nTel.:   +44 223 334761\nFax:    +44 223 334679\n"}

{"group": "comp.windows.x", "text": "From: jc@minya.UUCP (John Chambers)\nSubject: painting with increasing resolution\nLines: 40\n\nSome  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and\nit seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and\ncan point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:\nGiven a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\ndata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\nlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\npicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\nmight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\npixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\nwould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\npainted.\n\nSince  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\nof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted\nas  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to\nbe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\nsmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\nmagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\nserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\nask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\nonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\n(\"Permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window?\n\nIt seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\nsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\none by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\nBut  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice\nto hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I\nobviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool\navailable that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.\n\nOh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build\ndemos  that  can  show such things as \"If this were run across, say, a\n4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.\"  Then  the\ncustomer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.\n\n-- \nIf the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  now\ncost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would\nexplode, killing all its passengers.\n"}

I've seen this sort \nof effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT \nconflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video \nhardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the \nQ950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to \n24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - \nit's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed \nthen.\n\nAnother thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like \nQuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some \nof) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.\n\n- Dale Adams\n"}

For every combination of response, the alert \nreappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The\nFDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable\nof ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether\nthere is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external \nconnector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.\n\nWith the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great \n(MacEKG reports no errors).

When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and\nwaits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an\nerror if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending\nAND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it\nwith their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very\nwell have different requirements.\n\nMy favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but\nalso run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD\nand DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through\nto SG.\n\nI have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it\nwith a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.\nThe advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.\n\nGordon Lang\n"}

People seem perfectly capable\n\tdealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF\n\tis frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and\n\tFAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries\n\twhich deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather\n\tthan with simply decoding the tags and parameters.\n\n\tPerhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather\n\tsimpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest\n\tthat TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.\n\n\tThat doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about\n\tusing it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end\n\tphotos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would\n\tnever do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,\n\tbut it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).\n\tJPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.\n\n\tThe advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle\n\tall these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.\n\tBut I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging\n\tsystems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.\n\n\tYou may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes\n\tbut please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity\n\tit contains is required to provide the functionality it does and\n\tdoesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially\n\tviable file formats.\n\n\n\tIf we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all\n\tgo program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length\n\tencoding.\n\n\n"}

What is XFree86?\n\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\n\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\n       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\n       distributions.\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\n       cards is now included.\n\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\n\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\n       more information.)\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \n       information).\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\n\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\n       in the source distribution for full details.\n\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\n\n4. What OSs are supported?\n\n    XFree86 supports:\n\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\n\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\n\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\n\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\n\n\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\n\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\n\n\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\n\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\n\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\n\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\n\n5. What video hardware is supported?\n\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\n\n\tTseng ET4000\n\tTseng ET3000\n\tParadise PVGA1\n\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\n\t\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\n\tGenoa GVGA\n\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\n\tATI 18800, 28800\n\n\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\n\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\n\t256 color mode.\n\n\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\n\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\n\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\n\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\n\n\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\n\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\n\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\n\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\n\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\n\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\n\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\n\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\n\tfuture XFree86 releases.\n\n\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\n\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\n\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\n\twork with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.\n\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\n\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\n\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\n\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\n\n\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\n\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\n\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\n\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\n\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot\n\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\n\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\n\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\n\tworking fine on them.\n\n6. What about accelerated boards?\n\n\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\n\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\n\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\n\n\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\n\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\n\n\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\n\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\n\n7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\n\n\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\n\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\n\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\n\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\n\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\n\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\n\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\n\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).\n\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\n\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\n\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\n\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\n\n\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\n\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\n\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\n\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\n\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\n\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \n\tlower bound.\n\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\n\n\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\n\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\n\t\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\n\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\n\t\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\n\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\n\n\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\n\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\n\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\n\n\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\n\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tftp.win.tue.nl\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tferkel.ucsb.edu\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\n\t\tstasi.bradley.edu\t\t- SVR4 binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\n\t\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/ISC\n\t\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\n\t\ttsx-11.mit.edu\t\t\t- Linux binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\n\t\tagate.berkeley.edu\t\t- 386BSD binaries\n\t\t\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\n\t\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\t\t\t- Mach binaries\n\t\t\tunder /i386\n\n\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\n\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\n\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\n\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\n\tmade when building the distribution.\n\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n11. Installation directories\n\n\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\n\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\n\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\n\n\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\n\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\n\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\n\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\n\n12. Configuration files\n\n\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\n\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\n\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\n\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\n\n\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\n\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\n\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\n\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\n\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\n\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\n\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\n\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\n\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\n\n\tIf this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \n\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\n\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\n\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\n\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\n\n\tNOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and\n\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\n\t      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from\n\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\n\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\n\t      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your\n\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\n\t      starting the server in the future.\n\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\n\n\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\n\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\n\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\n\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\n\n\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\n\n15. SVR4\n\tWhy won't my xterm run properly?\n\n\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\n\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.\n\tcsh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'\n\n\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\n\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\n\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\n\n16. SVR3\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.\n\n17. 386BSD\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\n\n\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\n\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\n\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\n\n\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\n\n18. Linux\n\n\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\n\tjump libraries installed.\n\n\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\n\n\tIf your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to\n\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\n\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\n\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\n\t-pn argument to X386.\n\n\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\n\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\n\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\n\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\n\tstartx won't.\n\n\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\n\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\n\n\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\n\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\n\n19. Mach\n\n\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\n\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\n\n\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\n\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\n\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\n\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\n\n20. BSD compatibility library\n\n\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\n\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\n\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\n\tseed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include\n\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\n\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are\n\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\n\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\n\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\n\n\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\n\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\n\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see\n\tsomething like\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\n\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\n\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\n\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\n\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\n\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\n\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\n\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\n\tadd 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\n\nXFree86 Contact Information\n\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\n    Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:\n\n\tThe original \"gang of four\":\n\t\tDavid Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>\n\t\tGlenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>\n\t\tJim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>\n\t\tDavid Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>\n\n\tThose supporting non-SYSV operating systems:\n\t\tRobert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]\n\t\tRich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]\n\t\tOrest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]\n\n    e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.\n\n\t--------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions,\nespecially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).\n-- \nSteve Kotsopoulos  P.Eng.           mail:   steve@ecf.toronto.edu\nSystems Analyst                     bitnet: steve@ecf.UTORONTO.BITNET\nEngineering Computing Facility      uucp:   uunet!utai!ecf!steve\nUniversity of Toronto               phone:  (416) 978-5898\n"}

If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP\nfile for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5\") under MS Windows 3.1 via either\nProgram Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell \nhas errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not.\n\nThe corruption is detected by executing \"pkunzip -t b:\\file.zip\" after \nboth copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption.\n\n\nNow here's the kicker:\n\n\nI have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps.\nSupposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the \nDOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).\n\n\nSo, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running,\nand one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this \nscenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows\napps and one slice for the running DOS app.  \n\nWhen copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks\nare essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and\n95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = \n.72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. \n\nWhen copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell\n(no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task\nmanager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice\n(assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: \n(1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time.\n\nSo why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU\ntime?

Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even\n| have a 50MHz local bus running...\n\n| I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n| 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\n| the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\n| that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nHaving in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.\nIt has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized\nby the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may\nshare experience on that.)\n\nAlso, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal\ncache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.\nSo my advice is the 66/VLB.\n\n| We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n| ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\n| been uncovered!  \n\n| There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\n| running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\n| a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\n| There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\n| don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\n| medium size images.\n\nHave You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have\npaging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is\ncached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more\nmemory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).\n\n| I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\n| machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \n| on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\n| transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \n| images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\n| make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n| (above), for that reason.\n\nThe bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from\n0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the\nsame results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed\n(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is\nlousy.\n\n| Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!\n\nThe rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come\nout. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only\nsell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.\n\n| Any information is greatly appreciated.\n\nJust some view, not much figures.\n\n--\nPenio Penev  x7423 (212)327-7423 (w) Internet: penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu\n\nDisclaimer: All oppinions are mine.\n"}

It was to create a format that could be\nread and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has\na built in compression scheme (LZW?).\n\nIFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package\nimages, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was\ncreated by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.\nIt was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.\nThe most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved\nBitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.\n\nInformation on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats\n(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)\n\nWayne Rigby\nrigby@cs.unr.edu\n"}

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\n          PHIGS\".\n\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\n          based on PHIGS.\n\n          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.\n\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\n\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\n          mainframes.\n\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\n          and translucency.\n\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\n\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\n\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\n\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\n          Starbase.\n\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many\n          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-\n          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS\n          or ARENA is available on request.\n\n          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-\n          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most\n          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-\n          porates PEX support.\n\n          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital\n          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the\n          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.\n          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with\n          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most\n          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as\n          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and\n          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.\n\n          AXP, DEC, and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment  Cor-\n          poration.

Brown Associates.\n\n------\n\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\npenetration.\n\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\n\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\nthem separately as needed.\n\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\nsolution.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBrian\n\nPS This was reprinted without permission.

You turn on\nyour computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it\ncools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles\nof this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics\nare much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact\nportable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function\nthat extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal\ncycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my\ncomputer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it\noff (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the\nphosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in\nthe computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue\nlife of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular\narchitecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :\") \n\nCharles Kuehmann\nNorthwestern University\nSteel Research Group\n"}

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D.

After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.

He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.

Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display.

If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican\nLibrary as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of\nRome as a political and scholarly superpower during the\nRenaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson\nBuilding of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through\nApril 30, 1993.

Each\nsection consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit\ndirectory and contains the exhibit text for that section and\nseparate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit\nincludes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,\nbut also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if\nthere were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items\nomitted later in the planning process.\n\n     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance\nscholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of\nscience or medicine, early music scholars, students of the\nhumanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,\ntheologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and\nto librarians and information professionals.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\nNeXT:\n\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\ncurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\ndoes not support JPEG.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n-- \n\t\t\ttom lane\n\t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\n"}

Please tell!\n\nI have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good\nsuccess in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of\npeople cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command\n(a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear\npeople saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in\nMicrosoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:\n\n  \"JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if\n  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for\n  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives\n  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use\n  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.\"\n\nWithin this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I\nhave found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems\nthat have been \"mounted\" using join.\n\nIn particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very\nconfused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It\nwants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then\ndelete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.\n\nUnfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic\nplace other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the\njoined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original\n*.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you\nsearch your disk systems, the document is gone.\n\nI have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box\nwhen JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\\temp with a 4meg\nramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an \"ls\" on the c:\\temp\ndir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to \nreproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think\nthis is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw\nDOS.\n\nSo, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not\nbe as robust you would like.\n\nWouldn't it be real great to \"mount\" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main\nfile tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,\nJOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch\nto let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.\n\nIt's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would\navoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was\nmeant for casual, even ignorant users, so \"mounting\" all the drives in\none file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry\nthis over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant \nusers -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs\na recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.\n\n--\nJerome (Jerry) Schneider             Domain: jls@atg.COM \nAspen Technology Group               UUCP:   {uunet}!csn!atglab!jls\nPO Box 673, Ft.

I haven't actually used one\nor seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see\nan independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or\nsomething.\n\nBasically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that\nrun OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are\nbinary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali\nis their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by\nsimply adding \"transformation engines\".\n\nThe two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation\nand the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.\n\n\n\t\t\t3400\t\t\t3500\n\nCPU\t\t\tDEC Alpha AXP 133MHz\tDEC Alpha AXP 150MHz\nOn-chip cache\t\t8k/8k\t\t\t8k/8k\nOnboard cache\t\t512K\t\t\t512K\nWord Size\t\t64-bit\t\t\t64-bit\nMemory ( initial )\t32-128MB\t\t32-256MB\nMemory ( future )\t512MB\t\t\t1GB\nSPECMARK89\t\t111\t\t\t126\nSPECINT92\t\t75\t\t\t84\nSPECFP92\t\t112\t\t\t128\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nTransform Modules\t1-6\t\t\t1-6\nFrame Buffer Modules\t5,10,20\t\t\t5,10,20\nFrame Buffer\t\t1280x1024x24bit\t\t1280x1024x24bit\n\t\t\tdouble buffered\t\tdouble buffered\nZ-buffer\t\t24-bit\t\t\t24-bit\nAlpha/stencil\t\t8-bit\t\t\t8-bit\nStereo support\t\tyes\t\t\tyes\nOther:\t\t\t\tboth machines will double buffer or do\n\t\t\t\tstereo output per window.

I have had\n>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.\n>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?\n \nCertainly. Reference follows. \n\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\n\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\n\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\n\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\n\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\n\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\n\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\nduuteranopia:\n\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \n\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\n\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\n\n>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow\n>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour\n>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!\n\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\ncouple of weeks ago.\n\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\nhelp here.)\n\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\nhave the monitor data.\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\nwhite) until it is displayable.\n\n>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is\n>sufficient interest\n\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window\nis popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. \nAt this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.\n\nIf a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it\nneeds to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it\nthere.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow\nrequest that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The\nIntrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after\nwmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because\nthe request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the\nsame.)\n\nThe solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information\nin ReparentNotify events.

Taking advantage of the 32-bit\ndigital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,\nthe camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,\nwith 256 gray levels, on the screen.\n\nUsers will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record\ndetail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera\nis expected to cost between $150 and $250.\n\nThe systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's\nCasper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have\nto purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.\n\nThe two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility\ncalled the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by\napplications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.\n\nThe Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support\nfor up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an\nFPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will\nrequire a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.\nUsers will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the\nCyclone's.\n\nFor more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.\n"}

This card is fairly fast,\nwill do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS\n(the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of\nan old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those\nprograms than the modern boards I have tried.

The monitor I am using it with is a 17\" Magnavox,\nwhich also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match.\n\nBut...\n\nThat is for my wife.

This frees the\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\n\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\n\n> \n> Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,\n> but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):\n> \n> \"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board\n> direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.\"\n> I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  \n> So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT\n> HDD controller doesn't!?!?

The problems you present are exist anyway,\nand I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such\nproblems to my programs in the first place.\n\nGamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image\nas I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image\nback to 24 bit image.\n\n\n>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How\n>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global\n>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and\n>>>much more complicated.\n\nOk, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit\nand user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,\njumps off the discussion a bit.\n\nMy solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit\nimage -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.\n\n\nAbout changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:\nchanging individual colors in colormap is useless in most\ncases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may\nmake serious errors to anywhere in the image.\nXV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the\nmentioned type images.\n\nMoreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global\nchanges. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like\npaint program job.\nIf person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the\noriginal 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit\nimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to\nmodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if\nimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7\ncursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --\nselecting individual color is possible from that.\n\nOk, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen\nsuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention\n24bit painting program in 8bit screen...\n\n\n>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?\n\nIt saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\ndesigned for that.\nAlso, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,\nperson would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\nexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed\nwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect the\nprogram work -- design error.\n\nI have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\nit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\nmajor change to the original design.\n\nSo, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\nimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\n\nBefore anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\n'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\nup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\neven the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\n(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\n\n\nWell, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to\nread it.\n\n\nJuhana Kouhia\n"}

They will continue to service interrupts, etc.,\netc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter\nwhat it's doing.\n\nI suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use\ncircuitry which has more transistors than other\ninstructions, but if you consider the additional heat\ngenerated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors\nand then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's\npackaging, the change in temperature to the immediate\nenvironment (ie. the surface of the package) will be\nnegligible.\n\nCheers, Ben\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBen J.

I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or\n: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)\n\nI do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation\nfor ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-\nmodem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't\nreally a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial\nI wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,\nbut you should still check your software!\n\nI will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is\na commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a\nmodem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications\nhardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA\nCommunications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the\nconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is\na \"DB-25\" but IBM has set an alternative \"standard\" of DB-9.  The primary\nsignals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).\nThere are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.\nFor example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate\nin communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an\noutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that\nit is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)\nsignal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's\nfive signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)\nsignal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used\nto ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok\nvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input\nto the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)\nare Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs\nto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -\na signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection\nto the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.\nDCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the \"connection\" has been established\ni.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh\nthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have\nexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:\n\nName    DB-9     DB-25\n SG       5        7\n TD       3        2\n RD       2        3\nDTR       4       20\nDSR       6        6\nDCD       1        8\nRTS       7        4\nCTS       8        5\n RI       9       22\n\nNow to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE\nto a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232\nsignal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert\nthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these\nsignals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If\nthis is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,\nand crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other\nend, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send\ndata has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just\nsend the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would\ninclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the\nsoftware area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-\nware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the\nserial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to\nbe used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-\nLink or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The\nonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also\nfairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And\nthat is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for\nflow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the\nDTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the\nDCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast\nto the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by\nasserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can\nsend.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow\ncontrol?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,\none common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no\nwires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF\ncommands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware\nflow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because\nyour data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol\nsignals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract \"escape\"\ncodes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-\nware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to\ndo it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods\nis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair\ngame.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.\nBut I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with\nall of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,\nI am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control\nthe RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the\nclear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a\ndiffernt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling\nstuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS\nsignal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-\ning it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the\nRTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other\npossible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain\nsignals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would\nmean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting\nthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like\nthis.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more\n\"gotcha\" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to\nsee the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the\nDTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but\nthe RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And\nof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must\npass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,\nif any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not\nspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use\nthis one.\n\n    TD  ------  RD\n    RD  ------  TD\n    DTR ------ DSR\n    DSR ------ DTR\n    DCD ------ RTS-\\\n  /-RTS ------ DCD |\n  \\-CTS        CTS-/\n\n\nGordon Lang\n\n"}

{"group": "comp.graphics", "text": "From: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (David Gorgen)\nSubject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together\nOrganization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA)\nKeywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas\nLines: 84\n\nI'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low\napparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different\nPEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).\n\nI'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\n\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\nline is supposed to be solid.\n\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\n\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\n\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\nthe stitching.\n\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\n\nI've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\n5.1.\n\nOpen questions:\n    (1) Why does this happen?\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\n            could be corrected for?\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\n            interpolators?\n        --  Something else?\n    (2) What to do about it?\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\n            artifacts?\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\n\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\n\n-- \n===============================================================================\nDave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com\nApplicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com\nAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen\n"}

The next generation takes\n>the radical lead now.  Don't look for radicalism among us\n>old ones; we're gone...\n\nPerhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed\nmy and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.\nIt is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:\n\n   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge\n   2) one's financial situation takes precedence\n   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)\n   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from \"fun\" to \"work\"\n   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for \"the hobby\"\n\nor the biggest killer (IMO)\n\n   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's\n      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without\n      the motivation the effort seems useless.\n\nAnother set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember\nwhen there were several completely different computer systems, our children\nare growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy\nthe diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early\neighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems\nthat were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely\ndivergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new\nsystems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was\nneeded we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a\ncommercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being\ntaught the \"user\" mentality.  As the number of us \"old-timers\" dwindle we are\nnot being replaced by the next generation.\n\nKendall.\n-- \n   Kendall Sears                           krsear02@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\n   Programmer                             ///\n   Child Development Unit                /// Amiga\n   Department of Pediatrics          \\\\\\/// Currently running AmigaOS 3.0\n   University of Louisville           \\XX/ And Supporting Unix Sys V Rev 4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLife is a game you play once.

A veronica search produces a menu of gopher\n     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.\n     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy\n     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the\n     gopher protocol.\n\n     To try veronica, select it from the \"Other Gophers\" menu on \n     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:\n\n     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) \n     Type=1 \n     Port=70 \n     Path=1/veronica \n     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ8: What is Available for Biology?\n\nA8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information\n    availble to biologists now by gopher.\n\nHere is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search \nvia gopher:\n\n      2.

The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close\nto the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so\nmuch a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.\nWhy else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business\napplication. \n\nWhat do you mean by 'no \"retail price\"'.  Quite the contrary, I think.\nThe price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,\nIMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling\nrequired.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One\nprice, medium performance, ready to go.\n\nWhen I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears\n(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and\nBizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the\nother was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who\nwent the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who\nsells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I\nsuspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know\ndidly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any\nof the  Apple dealers I spoke with...\n\nIf you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from\nMontgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.\nI'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple\nPerforma Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that\ndecision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out\nwith a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.  \n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstrument Approach Procedures Automation             DOT/FAA/AMI-230\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBryan D.

Why is it that, if a person\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \n\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\n\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\"\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\ncomputer industry?\n\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"       |\n|  \"Szechuan Death\"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\n|                             |            \"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\"|\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n"}

I love the Mac interface and any number\nof the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily\nand am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost\nevery model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari\nST simply \"blow the Mac out of the water\" in terms of performance. At this time\nI would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the\nadvantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would\nget their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in\nmuli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((\n\n > I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is\n> so bad (comparatively).

If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the\nspeed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms.\n\nAs for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems\nalmost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be\nfaster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a\ngraphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the\nQuadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc...\n\n> Oh well, y'all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02\n\nI think mine was only worth $0.01.......\n---------------------------------------------------------------------->\n|-! -David Butler- dhbutler@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\n\n  \"This is not a novel to be tossed away lightly;\n   it should be thrown with great force.\"         -Dorothy Parker\n"}

Specifically, a comparison between the\nCanon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people\nasked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I\nreceived.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have\nnot deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so\nyou can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an\nunbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests\nfavoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you\nbelieve unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a\nwide range of comments, each has its own value.  \n\nThere was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its\nprice/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability\nof the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid\nbackground).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new\nprinter to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around\nsummertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first\ninkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of\nre-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely\ndepends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop\naround first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your\nprinter).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will\nprint, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets\n(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,\nthat's a brief research summary of my personal research.

Just using regular copier paper\nproduced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the\noutput of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my\nBJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed\nhow well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was\nseveral seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the\nHP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first\nindicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).\n\nI showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one\nimmediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders\ntoo.

Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using\nTrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for\nthe HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy\npaper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality\n'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find\ncopy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows\ndriver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few\n'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType\nbut haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless\nthe speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges\ncan't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.\n\nFor graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via\nthe HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as\n'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on\nthe type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem\narises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The\nrange of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more\nof a limitation with inkjet printers in general.\n\n>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.\n\nHowever, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from\nEpson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing\nlaser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX\n- something I think?\n\nI purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The\nintroductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.\n \n===========================================================================\n\nAbout a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is\nincredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever\ndo stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from\nMicrosoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had\nare printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on\ncheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you\ncan only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve\ninches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The\nprinter comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other\ncomplaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for\nthose archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.\nThe teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it\nbetween now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine\nfrom a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend\nwho has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone\nhas drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!\n\nHope I helped!\n\n(360dpi sure looks great!)\n\nHeather Stehman\n\n===========================================================================\n\nIn article <1993Apr19.122649.25263@schbbs.mot.com>, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com (Craig Witkowski) writes:\n> In message <1993Apr18.041741.6051@CSD-NewsHost.Stanford.EDU>\n> kayman@csd-d-3.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kayman) writes:\n> Hello fellow 'netters.\n> \n>>I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I\n>>should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality\nare similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet\nfor home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support\nin so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM\nProprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be\nthe case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use\ncut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit\ncheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.\n\n  Just my $0.02 worth..\n\n-- \nMike Mattix\nAgricultural Group of Monsanto\nP.O.

I actually thought of some other points after I posted the\nnote.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around\nthe paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics\nresolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:\nWordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and\ncould not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers\ngives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer\nhence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.\nI had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no\ncomparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration\nthe Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.\n\nI went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I\nspent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at\nwork this month anyway.\n\nRegards\n\nMike Mattix\nAg Group of Monsanto\nLuling, LA\n\n===========================================================================\n\nI spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet\nBJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:\n\n1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon\n2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference\n3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.\n\nThe BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the\nBJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.\n\nAs you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything\nbig with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I\nknow that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the\nprinter, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with\nthe printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one\ncomes from - Microsoft?)\n\nHope this helps.\n-- \nThomas V.

The printing quality is a bit better,\nbut you you've got much more possiblities.

The Canon was a bit better..\n\nGreetz,\n\nKris\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWhen we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to\ninkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.\nWe use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling\nqualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print\nquality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end\nup buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are\nusing Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out\nof 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and\nthat was taken care of very quickly by HP.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Nate\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWhenever I buy anything I look at what the \"experts\" say, pick out the top\nfew and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been\nunusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a\nfew times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.\n\nI can't remember much about the process except that I read about three\nreviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I\nbought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build\na multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner\ntowards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I\ntried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the\nresult.\n\nI note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour\nand mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still\nreadily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my\nviews/experience:\n\n\t1.\tI don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away\n\t\tfrom reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with\n\t\tthe idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.\n\n\t2.\tI believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the\n\t\tideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes\n\t\tthey have the expertise.\n\n\t3.\tThe 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly\n\t\tacceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from\n\t\tWindows.\n\n\t4.\tI used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured\n\t\ttypesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)\n\t\tand I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is\n\t\tpretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...\n\n\t5.\tThe HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.\n\n\t6.\tIf you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty\n\t\tslow with it, God knows what it's like without!\n\nI actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily\nuse.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and\nhaving a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.\n\nHope this is of use.\n\nRegards\n\nDavid\t\n\n===========================================================================\n\nJust bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with\n$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the\nDeskJet in print quality.\n\nSpeed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures).\n         I don't print long docs, though.\n\nQuality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is\n         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up\n         close; you can see a lot more \"jaggies\" than on a LaserJet.\n         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the\n         page/print head in place, I would imagine.\n\nLarge docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...\n         manual says up to 100, though.

I was really worried\nthat I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is\nfantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it\nprinted DAMN near laser quality.

You\n   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left\n   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your \"left\n   and right window\" as you can have as many open as you wish instead \n   of just two.\n\n2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking\n   on the executable's icon.\n\n3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double\n   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have\n   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The\n   \"browse\" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you\n   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.\n   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your\n   requirement for \"text reading and graphics viewing\".\n\nI know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up\nall the associations you need is the way to do it.\n\nIf Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be\npretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how\nsome things are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIskandar Taib                          | The only thing worse than Peach ala\nInternet: NTAIB@SILVER.UCS.INDIANA.EDU |    Frog is Frog ala Peach\nBitnet:   NTAIB@IUBACS                 !\n"}

Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of \nposting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.\n\nThis file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota\nPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with \nPHONE. \n\nFor additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at\n<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>\n\nBest wishes,\nAshok\n\n-- begin SLIP.TXT --\nBased on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here\nare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the\nTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring your Modem:\n\na) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)\n   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use\n   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program\n   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit\n   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.\n   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.\n\n   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a\n         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.\n\nb) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done\n   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of\n   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the\n   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and\n   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with\n   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver\n   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a\n   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.\n   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and\n   batch file examples.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring the SLIP drivers:\n\nThere are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available\nCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver\nSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver\nSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)\nETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)\nUMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)\n\nOf these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or\nETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:\n\na) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART\nb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others\n   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a\n   long FTP transfer.\nc) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode\nd) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with\n   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.\n\nInstructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)\na) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:\n   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1\n   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600\nb) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the\n   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual\n   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS\n   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all\n   use this virtual driver at 0x60.\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nc) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in\n   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:\na) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern\n   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware\n   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.\nb) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a\n   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.\n   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600\nc) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x\n   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\nd) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM\n   pktint.com\n\nInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:\nIf you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the\ninstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You\nwill have to DELETE the line \"device=*vcd\" from the [386Enh] section\nof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm\napplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped\ncharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not\nrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:\n   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguring Windows 3.1:\n\na) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]\n   section.\n   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.\n       COM1Base=03F8\n       COM1Irq=4\n       COM2Base=02F8\n       COM2Irq=3\n       COM3Base=03E8\n       COM3Irq=5\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,\n       but double-clicking on the \"Ports\" icon.\n   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer\n       COM1Buffer=10000\n   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish\n       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that\n       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to\n       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch\n       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value\n       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.\n       COM1AutoAssign=0\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.\n       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under \"Device Contention\", set\n       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to\n       \"Never Warn\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional notes:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each\nSLIP session?\n\nI am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user\na permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI\neach time that I establish a SLIP connection.\n\nIf you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,\nplease try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the\nconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP\nwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a\nsituation such as this, you must do the following:\n\nEdit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:\n\n[net]\nname=\nip=\nnetmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)\narptime=20\npacket_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)\n\nSave the changes, and then *write-protect* this file\n\"attrib +r qvtnet.ini\"\n\nStart your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address\nthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the\ngeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and\nIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],\nand you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not\nbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.\n\nA more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address\nassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\nVictor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.\nBootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a\nfile called \"myip\".  Another file \"noip\" is essentially a complete\nQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step \"myip\"\nand \"noip\" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of\nVictor's batch file is provided below:\n=====================================================\nslipper com2\npktint.com\nbootpq -i \"ip=\\\"%%s\\\"\"  >> myip\nbootpq -i \"My IP# is: %s\"\ncopy /q net + myip + noip e:\\com\\qvtnet\\qvtnet.ini\ndel /q myip\n@echo off\necho .\necho Ready to run WinQVTnet\n=====================================================\nFor questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor\nMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\n\nQPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?\n\nPKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes\nimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COM\n\nPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet\nsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:\n\nThe latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you\nuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with\napplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).\n\n[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]\n\nlh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)\nlh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)\nlh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)\nlh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)\npktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)\n\nAdditional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within\nWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is\ndirected to the file \"popmail.bat\".  This is what popmail.bat reads\nlike:\n\npktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60\ncd \\popmail\npopmail\ncd \\\npktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60\nexit                    causes the DOS window to close\n\nI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications\nlike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine\neven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS\nsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example\nwithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for\nGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each\ninstance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?\n\nI have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with\na reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these\nconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and\nbeing used as follows:\na) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session\nb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session\nc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS\n\nI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring\ncompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with\nSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session\nis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session\nis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same\nfiles.\n\nWhile there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,\nfor me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the\nperformance hit.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nC/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode\n\nIn ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the\napplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications\nthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even\nthese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3\n\nWhen SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,\nI get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads\n\"IP:incorrect packet type\" or \"IP:bad version number\".  This does not\nseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on\nloss of performance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?\n\nIn the rare event that you find a package that does not work with\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --\nPeter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him\nknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is\nkosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2\n\n(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)\n\nI load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate\nETHERSL.COM\n\nThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a\npacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box\nat a time.\n\nSo for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a\nmedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library\nof Medicine).\n\nethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP\ncd \\gm6\nsearch\ncd \\\ntermin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP\nexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows\n\nIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have\nany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing\nthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no\nproblem.

For example here is a script\nthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.\n\nBackground:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,\nand login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP\nsession with the following command \"slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu\",\nfollowed by my password -- again.\n\nHere then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -\n#\n# CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93\n# Last revised 3/28/93\nProcedure    Host.CWRU.Login\nTimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding'\nMessage         \"CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1\"\nMessage         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond'\nQuiet ON\nExpect 'Verification'\nMessage         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2'\nMessage         'Sending your user name and password'\nQuiet OFF\nExpect   'Username:'\nSend '%u<'\nExpect   'Password:'\nPrivate\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted'\nTimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request'\nExpect 'CWRU-TS2>'\nSend 'SLIP<'\nTimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command'\nExpect 'IP hostname or address:'\nSend '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<'\nTimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname'\nReject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname'\nExpect 'Password:'\nSend '%p<'\nReject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'\nTimeOut 10\nExpect 'Header Compression will match your system'\nMessage 'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful'\nWait 1.0\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.Login\n#\n#\nProcedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut\n# Nothing special needs to be done to logout\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut\n#\n#   End of Script file\n#\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?\n\nThe quick answer -- there is no \"clean\" way.  Below is a batch file\nhack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this\nexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a\nbatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you\nplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,\nport address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,\nCSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory\nor in your path ...\n\nAll that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection\nusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the\nconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...\n\n-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --\n@echo off\nrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn. \"SLIP.BAT\"\nrem   awaiting a version of C/SLIPPER that can directly interact\nrem   with PHONE\nrem   CWRUSLIP.BAT file is used with PHONE.EXE to start a SLIP\nrem   connection on CWRU-TS2\nrem   last modified 3/28/93 -- Ashok Aiyar\n\n@echo off\ncls\ngoto start\n\n:start\nif %1. == ?.         goto help\nif %1. == help.      goto help\nif %1. == setup.     goto setup\nif %1. == dial.      goto forceD\nif %1. == hangup.    goto forceH\nif %1. == quit.      goto forceH\nif %1. == HELP.      goto help\nif %1. == SETUP.     goto setup\nif %1. == DIAL.      goto forceD\nif %1. == QUIT.      goto forceH\ngoto bogus\ngoto unload\n\n:forceH\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone force hangup\ngoto unload\n\n:slipper\ntermin 0x60\nREM  the following line must be changed to reflect the COM port,\nREM  IRQ, baud rate, and software interrupt\nlh c:\\packet\\cslipper com1 vec=60 baud=57600 ether\ngoto end\n\n:forceD\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone force dial\ngoto slipper\n\n:setup\ntermin 0x60\numslip >nul\nphone setup\ngoto help\n\n:unload\ntermin 0x60\ngoto end\n\n:bogus\necho %1 is not a valid command.\necho Try \"cwruslip help\" for a list of valid commands\necho.\n\n:help\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\necho           Case Western Reserve University SLIP Setup\necho                  using Univ. of Minnesota PHONE\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\necho cwruslip setup     modem settings, phone number, username etc.\necho.\necho cwruslip dial      DIAL and establish the SLIP connection\necho cwruslip quit      HANGUP the phone and unload the driver\necho cwruslip help      this screen\necho.\n\n:end\n-- end CWRUSLIP.BAT --\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhere to Get What.....\n\nPeter Tattam's programs are archived at ftp.utas.edu.au (C/SLIPPER,\nand the Trumpet set of programs).\n\nWinQVT/net is generally archived at most Windows FTP sites,\nincluding ftp.cica.indiana.edu\n\nNCSA Telnet is archived at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu\n\nNuPOP is archived at ftp.acns.nwu.edu\n\nPOPmail/PC, SLIPDISK, PHONE, and PC Gopher are archived at\nboombox.micro.umn.edu\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- end SLIP.TXT --\n\n\n\n--\nAshok Aiyar                        Mail: ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu\nDepartment of Biochemistry                       Tel: (216) 368-3300\nCWRU School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio         Fax: (216) 368-4544\n"}

AT any case, a lot\nof picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to\n.bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop\n(shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think,\nwhere VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I\"ll\npost a corection).\n\n\nThis, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you\nhave to rename it.\n\nNOW, another thing....\nthis is from the windows' FAQ:\n\nyour file has to be less than 64 K\n( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than\nabout 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know).\n\nYour file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size\nis.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a\nway to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,\nsuch as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about\nthis, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a\nwindows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the\nfilename). \n\nALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.\n\nThese specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings\nwork quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little\nmemory.\n\nFinally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your\nnew win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from a\ndirectory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of\nthe one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.\n\n\nShare this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).\n\nMickey\n\n-- \npe-|| ||  MICHAEL PANAYIOTAKIS: louray@seas.gwu.edu \nace|| ||                                   ...!uunet!seas.gwu.edu!louray\n|||| \\/|  *how do make a ms-windows .grp file reflect a HD directory??*\n\\\\\\\\   |  \"well I ain't always right, but I've never been wrong..\"(gd)\n"}

Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at\nleast), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for\nbus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require\nmultiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.\nEISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I\nwould expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  \n\nSo I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect\nhim to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does\nnot.  \n\n-- \n\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live\n in the real world.\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.\n"}

When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this\n      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy\n      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like\n      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.\n      The header line in 'read' menu includes \"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\".\n        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.\n      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use\n        for reading current file.\n      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This\n        program will automatically determine which format this file is.\n        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check\n        standard extension. Still fail, report error.\n      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.\n        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key\n          (except ESCAPE).\n        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.\n+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.\n        ESCAPE to terminate.\n      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.\n      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.\n+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.\n\n   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.\n      You can do special effect on image.\n      pressing RETURN: show image.\n        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text\n        mode.\n      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do\n        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.\n      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.\n      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.\n        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).\n        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).\n        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).\n        True Color: save as 24-bit image.\n\n        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image\n        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program\n        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another\n        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after\n        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change\n        directory to what you want. Then,\n\n        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.\n        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename\n                      (filename under bar).\n\n\n  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.\n\n  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,\n     the performance is poor.\n\n  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :\n       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...\n\n     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):\n       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster\n       (No one is better for true 24bits image)\n\n  6.

If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the\nmonitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go\nfrom the monitor to the back of the computer.\n\n2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing\npower cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the\ncomputer.\n\nBoth cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer\nstores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at\ngood prices).

It evaluates everything to\ntrue no matter what the conditionals are.\nFor example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed\nby Sun) - namely Xos.h:\n\n#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)\n#       include <string.h>\n#       define  index   strchr\n#       define  rindex  strrchr\n#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */\n#       include <strings.h>\n#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */\n\nHere 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements\nto 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist\nunder Solaris2.\nWe also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.\nWe got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.\n\nIn all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's\ndistribution) mentions this problem:\n\nBUGS\n     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C\n     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way\n     that all #if directives will evaluate to  \"true\"  regardless\n     of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include\n     directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have\n     its own parser written for #if expressions.\n\nHas anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than\nWriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?\n\nSince we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply \ndirectly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.\n\nThanks in advance.\n***************************************************************************\n*     Michael Turok                  *                                    *\n*  Information Resources, Inc.       * E-Mail:  mlt@blues.infores.com     *\n*     200 Fifth Avenue               * Voice:  (617) 890 1100 ext.7531    *\n*  Waltham, MA 02154, USA            * Fax:    (617) 890 4660             *\n***************************************************************************\n"}

Version 3.1.7\nX\nXCopyright 1992 Duncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk>\nX\nXTrivial to install, but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial.\nX\nXThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed, just\nXedit the \"rx.pl\" file, and read the comments.  Once you've done\nXthis you can \"xmkmf\", then \"make install install.man\".\nX\nXFEATURES:\nX\nX*) Does the right thing for off-site remote execution.  Including\nX   setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names, and passing\nX   magic cookies, or doing the \"xhost\" stuff.\nX\nX*) Allow different remote user name.  (rx -l user host ...)\nX\nX*) Smart quoting of arguments - makes passing wild-cards easy.\nX\nX*) Custom command execution - link it to \"remacs\" to get a remote\nX   emacs command.\nX\nX*) Automatic xterm options - names the xterm according to hostname,\nX   and turns on \"login shell\".\nX\nX*) Default command is xterm.\nX\nX*) Propagates X-ish env. variables to remote session - user may\nX   extend the list of variables to pass.\nX\nX*) Special handling for bourne shell users.\nX\nX*) Tries to do remote execution from same directory as local.\nX   That is, it propagates $PWD, in an intelligent manner.\nX\nX*) Logs errors in a file.\nX\nX*) Overall Intelligence (TM) - makes reasoned decisions about what\nX   you are trying to do, and tries to \"do the right thing\".\nX\nX*) Written in Perl, for portability and hackability.\nX\nXFor more info, read the man page or the source.\nX\nEND_OF_FILE\nif test 1442 -ne `wc -c <'README'`; then\n    echo shar: \\\"'README'\\\" unpacked with wrong size!\nfi\n# end of 'README'\nfi\nif test -f 'Imakefile' -a \"${1}\" != \"-c\" ; then \n  echo shar: Will not clobber existing file \\\"'Imakefile'\\\"\nelse\necho shar: Extracting \\\"'Imakefile'\\\" \\(370 characters\\)\nsed \"s/^X//\" >'Imakefile' <<'END_OF_FILE'\nX# Glasgow RX Imakefile.\nX\nX         PROGRAMS = rx\nX\nXall:: $(PROGRAMS)\nX\nXinstall:: safe\nX\nXInstallNamedProg(rx.pl,rx,$(BINDIR))\nXInstallManPage(rx,$(MANDIR))\nX\nXinstall::\nX\t$(RM) $(BINDIR)/rxterm\nX\t$(LN) $(BINDIR)/rx $(BINDIR)/rxterm\nX\nXsafe:\nX\t@grep -s 'debug = 0' rx.pl || false\nX\nXshar: safe\nX\tmakekit -m -p\nX\t@-perl -pi -e \"s/sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk/sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk/;\" Part*\nX\nEND_OF_FILE\nif test 370 -ne `wc -c <'Imakefile'`; then\n    echo shar: \\\"'Imakefile'\\\" unpacked with wrong size!\nfi\n# end of 'Imakefile'\nfi\nif test -f 'MANIFEST' -a \"${1}\" != \"-c\" ; then \n  echo shar: Will not clobber existing file \\\"'MANIFEST'\\\"\nelse\necho shar: Extracting \\\"'MANIFEST'\\\" \\(313 characters\\)\nsed \"s/^X//\" >'MANIFEST' <<'END_OF_FILE'\nX   File Name\t\tArchive #\tDescription\nX-----------------------------------------------------------\nX README                     1\tRead me first\nX Imakefile                  1\t\nX MANIFEST                   1\tThis shipping list\nX Makefile                   1\t\nX rx.man                     1\t\nX rx.pl                      1\t\nEND_OF_FILE\nif test 313 -ne `wc -c <'MANIFEST'`; then\n    echo shar: \\\"'MANIFEST'\\\" unpacked with wrong size!\nfi\n# end of 'MANIFEST'\nfi\nif test -f 'Makefile' -a \"${1}\" != \"-c\" ; then \n  echo shar: Will not clobber existing file \\\"'Makefile'\\\"\nelse\necho shar: Extracting \\\"'Makefile'\\\" \\(10172 characters\\)\nsed \"s/^X//\" >'Makefile' <<'END_OF_FILE'\nX# Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!\nX# $XConsortium: imake.c,v 1.65 91/07/25 17:50:17 rws Exp $\nX#\nX# The cpp used on this machine replaces all newlines and multiple tabs and\nX# spaces in a macro expansion with a single space.

To allow the execution\nXof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to\nXthe remote session.  If you omit\nX.IR command ,\nXthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The\nX.B rxterm\nXvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes\nX.I args\nXto the remote xterm as arguments.\nX.PP\nXShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local\nXmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote\nXmachine.\nX.PP\nXIf the name of the file from which\nX.B rx\nXis executed is anything other than ``rx,''\nX.B rx\nXtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command\nXto run on the remote host, using any\nX.I command\nXparameters as arguments for the remote command.\nX.PP\nXIf\nX.B rx\nXthinks you are using\nX.B xauth\nXbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or\nXto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization\nXkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use\nX.B xhost(1)\nXto grant access to the remote host.\nX.SH OPTIONS\nX.TP\nX.BI \\-l \" username\"\nXUse\nX.I username\nXas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence\nXof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username.\nX\nX.SH ENVIRONMENT\nXIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR,\nXXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,\nXand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the\nXremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which\nXcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the\nXvariable RXENV.\nX.PP\nXThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified\nXa hostname as is needed.\nX.SH DIAGNOSTICS\nX.TP\nX.IB command \": don't recognise my name.\"\nX.B rx\nXcannot decode the name it has been called under.

It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,\nv.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so\nyou can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone\nline.  They will \"fall back\" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even\ndisable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to\nconnect with slower and older modems.\n\nIt has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with\nmulti-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).\n\nThey use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)\nwhich reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and\ncleanest connection possible.\n\nThese modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech\nsupport (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.\n\nThey also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the\nNEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which\nwill let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows\napplication just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of\nany font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax\ngraphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,\nas well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).\n\nI'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or\nbelow the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an\nequivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is\nbacked by a company that will never go away.\n\nThis price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of\ndowntown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home\nto pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal\nmodem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including\ninstallation.)\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem\nat an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for\nabout ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.\n\nIf you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at \n(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.\n\nThe modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.\n\nThanks.  \nPete\n\n"}

I was also\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\na smeared effect where they overlap.\n  Example:\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\n\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\nBravo!\n\n(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\nthrough proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)\n\n-- \n  Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]\n  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems\n  Austin TX\n * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *\n"}

But again it will not increase the speed\nof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even\nif your original processor runs at a slower speed.\nThere is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX\non it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX\nor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,\nthen you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and\nreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for\nboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip\ncosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the\n25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math\ncoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the\nOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a\n20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally\nand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is\nrated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.\n\nYou should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that\nadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop\naround as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for\na particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.\n\nLawrence Khoo\n\n-- \nkhoo@husc3.harvard.edu       Lawrence Khoo       Computer Consultant\nkhoo@haavelmo.harvard.edu    (617) 496-8992    Econ.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n   (for better or for worse).\n\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\n   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\n   frames.\n\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\n   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.\n\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\n   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\n   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\n   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\n   switching.\n\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\n   even more...\n\n   Lawrence D'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47' 26\" S, 175^ 19' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\n\n\nI'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\ncan significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take\ninto account:\n\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\n\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\n\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).\n\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\nmake a real difference.\n\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\n\n-Peter Lee\n\n \n--\n/-------------------- Peter E.

This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit\nprocessor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s\nPentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions\nper clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola\nis expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two\nconfigurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50\nSPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance\nfor the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89\nperformance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down\nversion of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000\nworkstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip\nwith protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus\nbuilt in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the\nMicro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop\nPowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,\nincluding ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source\nnoted.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has\nbeen extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive\narchitecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million\ntransistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to\nbe priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s\n486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one\nsource said.\n\n==== END REPOST ====\n"}

However...\n\n(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal\nthe Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch \"high resolution color\ndisplay\"---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.\n\nSo, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you\nneed (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the\nVGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use\nit's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor\nthat can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over\nthe VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot\nproduce).\n\nAs far as (a) above is concerned, contact\n\n James Engineering, Inc.\n 6329 Fairmount Ave.\n El Cerrito, CA  94530\n 510-525-7350\n FAX: 510-525-5740\n\nThey can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*\nwant the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to\nhave your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer\nwill just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want\nan adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style\nconnectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry\nfor the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.\n\nAs far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal\nwith a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of\n67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,\nthe VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and\na 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.\n\nThe monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as\nthe Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes\nin the PC compatible world.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\t-Fred Martin\n\n\n-- \nFred Martin | fredm@media.mit.edu | (617) 253-7143 | 20 Ames St. Rm.

If you have several hundred users who do\nwhat the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to\nhave your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager\nand the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.\n\nOur alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,\nit runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the\nrest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set\nup as normal and inherited by everything.

{"group": "comp.graphics", "text": "From: svec5@menudo.uh.edu (T.C. Zhao)\nSubject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations\nOrganization: University of Houston\nLines: 159\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu\n\n\n   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\n\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\n\nNAME\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\n\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\n\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\n\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\n\nFEATURES\n\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \n  the processed image will be displayed.\n\n  Current features include\n\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\n\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\n\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\alpha$\\small$\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\n\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\n\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\n\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\n    circle).\n\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\n\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\n\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\n    arbitrary order.\n\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\n\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\n\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\n\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\n\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\n\n  o Performs image type conversions.\n\n  o Converts image formats.\n\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\n\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\n    back and display it.\n\n  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.\n\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\n    resulting power spectra.\n\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\n\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\n      o  CompuServ GIF\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\n      o  TIFF\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\n\nHardware requirements:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\n\nWhere to get it:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\n   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73\n\n   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking\n\nAcknowledgement:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.\n   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.\n   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate\n  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of\n  your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical\n  kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it\n  (and you will like it).\n  \n  As always, any comments/bug reports are welcome.\n\n"}

COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM\nport, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just\nsearches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The\nfirst equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by\nthe rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set\nof \"standard\" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the\norder in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for\nserial ports.\n\nSo, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were\nthis address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS\nto determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the\nfield in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that\nthere are but 3 COMM ports installed.

Our computer environment is pretty split\nbetween Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But\nthere are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users\nhere.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter\nwhich AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there\nis no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been \ninconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity\nin a DOS program to selectively transport the files.\n\nThe question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into\nwindows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is \nin a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite\nclear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.\n\n\n-- T.J. Fiske\n\ntfiske@qualcomm.com\n"}

I've\nnever taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what\nI've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably\ndoesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure\nif the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier\nmodems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.\n\nagain, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated\nthe Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you\nwant a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find\npeople who HAVE worked with the Sportster.\n\npersonally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd\nbuy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this\nis exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right\nnow.\n\nand now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want\nto get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to\ncomp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll\nget in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you\nmay get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts\ncomplete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to\navoid spreading faulty info).\n\n>The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.\n\njust as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in\neither CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only\noperate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is\ncurrently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary\nmode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.\n\nand just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also\nsupported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).\n\n>The difference\n>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. \n\ntake a second look at the original question:\n\n>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:\n>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nsee the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST\nmodem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier\nV.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it\ntherefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.\n\nalso, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb\nversion of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are\neven older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.\n\n>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of\n>the same type unit to achieve this speed.\n\nHST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about\nHST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a\nproprietary modulation scheme.\n\n>The Sportster will do\n>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way\n>only.\n\nI do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some\nway.....\n\nfirst off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is\npart of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a\nfeature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter\nin the Courier DS manual).\n\nsecond, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an\nasymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed\nin both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,\nand has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed\nchannel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if\nyou're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of\ninfo back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,\na penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse\ndirections.\n\nV.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full\ndata rate in both directions at the same time.\n\nthird, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with\nsymmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.\n\n>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.\n\nagain, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable\nto whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large\nfootprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an\nupgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which\ncould eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two\nupgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.\n\nlater.....\n   --jim\n\n--\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W\nAMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

(hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable\n   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between\n   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\n   in the high-impedence mode.\n\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\n   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes\n   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically \n   disconnected by a jumper.\n\n   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold\n   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true\n   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and\n   that certainly isn't a requirement.)\n\n - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the\n   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance\n   reasons.  \n\nAnd the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.\n\nJoe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)\n"}

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming\ninterface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.\nXm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the\nAthena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both\nenvironments without changes, although many nice features are only\navailable when using Motif.\nIn some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing\na ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -\ndata of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated\nin rare cases.\n\nXm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to\nencapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many\nideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,\nwhich provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications\n(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and\na simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).\n\nTop level objects in Xm++:\n* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout\n  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw\n* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface\n  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this\n  distribution)\n\nControls (children of top level objects):\n'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',\n'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'\n\nThe staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap\nformat) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.\n\nEvent handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects\nXt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.\n\n\nCommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides\ncomponents for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very\nsimplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system\n(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a\nsoftware achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications\nwith multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).\nIf you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS\nPublications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be\nour paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of\nthe art' from 1991).\nCommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was\nused to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing\nprimitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to\nsupport bitmaps and some controls also.\nKnown problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always\nredraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an\nobject), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.\n\n\nAbout this first release:\n\nXm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here\nfor smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think\nI can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications\nfor any non-critical purposes.\nCommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will\nbe continued this year because we plan to use it for another research\nproject here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems\nto be stable and can be used for experimental applications.\n\nPlatforms: this release was compiled and tested on:\n  HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07\n  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1\n  PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6\n\nCaution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T\nstandard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or\nabove (the next release will be tested with both compilers).\n\nWhere to get it:\n================\n\nI have uploaded it on: export.lcs.mit.edu as: /contrib/Xm++.0.5.tar.Z\n\n(send a mail, if you cannot find it there, e-mail addr. below)\n\nWhere to find more information:\n===============================\n\nthe .../doc directory contains\n   INSTALL - how to build the libraries and examples\n   README.GNU - problems and limitations when using gnu g++ (read!!)\n   usersGuide.txt - a tutorial how to use Xm++\n   reference.txt - a first try of a Xm++ class reference manual\n\nthe README files in the .../samples gives a brief description of\neach of the seven samples.\n\n\nXm++/CommonInteract is free software for any non-profit purposes,\nsee the file .../lib/COPYRIGHT for details.\n\nSend any comments, bug reports and donations :-) to the Author:\n\n    Bernhard Strassl\n    Vienna User Interface Group\n\tInstitute for Applied Computer Science and Information Systems\n    University of Vienna\n    Lenaugasse 2/8, A-1080 Wien, Austria\n\ne-mail: xmplus@ani.univie.ac.at\n\n\n"}

First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8\nbit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are\nsaying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those\nparts of the program that cause the problem!!\n\n\n>Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global\n>changes. \n\nNot sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.\n\n>In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like\n>paint program job.\n>If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the\n>original 24bit image modified.

Not to mention\n>24bit painting program in 8bit screen...\n\nWell here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem\nto have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the\nnext. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one\nthrough.\n\n>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?\n\n>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\n>designed for that.\n\nAs I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of\nsaving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what\nthe problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.\n\n>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; \n\nSpeak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\nto the 8 bit image palette.\n\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\n\n>say,\n>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\n>expected that the image still is the same. \n\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\n\n>So, XV were designed\n>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the\n>program work -- design error.\n\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\n\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\n\n>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\n>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\n>major change to the original design.\n\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So \nfar, you have not done so.\n\n>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\n>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\n\nArgh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it\nif it is so easy.\n\nOr alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.\n\n>Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\n>'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\n>up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\n>even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\n>(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\n\nI think this is a bit of an exageration.\n\nWhat you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in\nthe states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else\nhad no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...\n\n>Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, \n\nyou bet\n\n>hopefully you suggeeded to\n>read it.\n\nMostly.

Also I use\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she \nwon't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \nused offline files.  \n\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly\ntempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around\nwith the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the \nshrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can\nhope can't I, after all, I have work to do).\n\nThe advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and \nhardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the \nupgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I\nstill need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) \nfrom some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation\ngoes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm\nallergic to command lines!  I plan to run a \"pure\" NT system.  Also, will \nNT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently \nhave stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite \nDisk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the \nsystem (It's cramped now).\n\nI realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT \nversion?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk\nwill be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)\na comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask \nChili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd\nrather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without\nDOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?\n\nAny feedback or advice (including \"forget NT\" with good reasons) is much\nappreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better\nmultitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up\nthe machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),\nand I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe\nthere are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing \nabout them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)\n\nPls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.\n\nThanks,\nNathan Gregory\np00211@psilink.com\n\n"}

Any one of the Corel\n\t3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly\n\ta number of times, mostly just running it's own applications.\n\n\tFor instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading\n\twith Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard\n\tVGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that\n\tI wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my \n\t.finger.  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless, \n\tI fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download\n\tfinished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten\n\tthe pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop\n\t(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).\n\t\n\tBlam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta\n\tsee the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session \n\tand got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were\n\toff--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).\n\tSo I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).\n\n\tPP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer \n\t\"connected\" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way--\n\tit told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it\n\twas _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. \n\tShutdown and reboot.\n\n\tOk, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...\n\n\tHm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let's see.. Ah, the \n\twindows list still comes up.  OK, let's try shutdown again.\n\n\tNo go.  Huh.\n\n\tAlright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow.\n\n\tHmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again.\n\tNothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.\n  \n\tIn this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but\n\tOS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s\n\tbeen compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_)\n\tuse.\n\n\n> OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or\n>(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.\n\n\n\tThat's the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on \n\tOS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that\n\twould just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs\n\tthat are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt,\n\ttask protection or no.  \n\n\tFor instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed\n\tWP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in\n\ta dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run\n\tWP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).\n\n\n\n>  If windows works for you,\n>then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of \n>choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each\n>task,\n\n\n\tPlease explain.  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is\n\twhen I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even\n\tthen, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per \n\tminute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing \n\tthis--I've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing).\n\n\n\n> and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS,\n\n\n\tNot sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six\n\tof these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2). \n\tWindows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the\n\tdisk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency \n\twere a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the \n\tIntel desktop.  \n\n\n> some of the\n>key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it\n>would be more of an even fight.\n\n\n\tOn the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence\n\tthat both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to\n\tthem.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine, \n\twhile the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows. \n\t(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash \n\tinstall).  On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive\n\tthan Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows\n\tjust doesn't like.  \n\n\n>Wittism of th week: \"I think that it's wrong to believe in an ism, you should\n>                     believe in yourself\"  Ferrish Bueller \n\n\t\n\tWasn't this _Ferris_ Bueller?\n\n\n-- \nThere are stupid laws, and then there are stupider than normal laws.\n"}

The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the\nCD300.

I hear that\nit is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.\n\nThe annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful\noptions, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that\nrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently\nin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on\nall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared\nto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --\nagain, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored\nby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also\nnote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably\ncompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that\nnone of the FAX formats are really useful.\n\nWhat's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,\ne.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have\nprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses\nbytes rather than pixels.\n\nBut the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register\nproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.\nThis means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably\nread all incoming TIFF files.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n-- \n\t\t\ttom lane\n\t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\n"}

The reflected\n| ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.\n| \n| Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours \n| along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol.

I suggest\nthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get \"An Introduction to Ray\nTracing\" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing\nalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\n\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you\nget some illumination equation like this:\n\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\n\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\n\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\n\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\npurple-colored glass object.\n\n    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my \"illumination\nequation sermon\" to you also.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nSteve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.\nhollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California\n"}

Still, the results are \nimpressive.\n\nWith my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following\nWinTach 1.0 results:\n\n\nCard\t\t\t\tWP\tCAD\tSpread\tPaint\tOverall\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nATI Graphics Ultra\t\t13.5\t14.5\t19.1\t25.0\t18.0\nATI Ultra+ (no aperture)\t11.2\t13.8\t10.7\t20.9\t14.1\nHercules Graphite VL\t\t16.1\t67.8\t41.4\t52.8\t44.5\n\nUnfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB\nhad an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as\nfast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.\n\nAs an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-\nredraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly\nheavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2\nseconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson's\ncontention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex\nMicrografx Draw document.\n\nSo far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.\nThe installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  And\nI didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...

Similarly,\n   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum\n   for SCO products in general.\n   \n   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO\n   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been\n   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt\n   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*\n   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.\n\n   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in\n   accordance with accepted procedure within \"biz\".  Given the content,\n   this change relocated the \"opendesktop\" newsgroup to a more proper place\n   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new \"announce\"\n   and \"general\" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former \"sco-list@uunet.uu.net\"\n   became \"scogen\" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.\n\n   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992\n   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific\n   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are\n   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy\n   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.\n   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to\n   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.\n\n   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion\n   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.\n   \n   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,\n   you are now able to subscribe to the following:\n   \n        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription\n        ---------                    -------------------------\n        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca\n\tbiz.sco.sources\t\t\t<none>\n\tbiz.sco.binaries\t\t<none>\n\tbiz.sco.magazine\t     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca\n\n   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET\n   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news\n   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and\n   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in\n   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.\n   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive\n   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.\n   \n   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion\n   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a\n   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.\n   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate\n   \"mailing list subscription\" address above, including in the message body:\n\n\tAdd: subscriber_address\t\t-eg-\n\tAdd: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-\n\tAdd: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname\n\n   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know\n   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled\n   the same way, simply substitute \"Delete:\" for \"Add:\", ensuring that\n   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list\n   subscribers receive \"how to post to the mlist\" article submission\n   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive\n   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test\n   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely\n   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do\n   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your\n   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list\n   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have\n   with the site(s) feeding you.\n   \n   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged\n   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we\n   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a\n   handful of subscribers this way each month.

Special thanks to Brian Evans of Georgia Tech  \nfor all the help.  \n\n--> FTP\n\n     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from \nmishna.esys.cwru.edu (Internet No. 129.22.40.23). A sample ftp session \nis given at the end of this file.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)\n\n\tIn this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of \nthe more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  \nSince Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working \nLaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than \nMathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK \nsmaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported \nthe LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the \nCOSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For \npower users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  \nfine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at \nthe anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  \nthe  downside, the disadvantage of this update \ncan be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its \nprevious version. \n\n\n***********************************************************************\t\n--> For Mathematica 2.0 users\n\t\n\tWe have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  \nthe directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  \nthe Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. \n\n**************************************************************************\n\t    \n--> Introduction\n   \n    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems \nanalysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using \nMathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  \nmodern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. \n    \n    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a \nNeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been \nused as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control \nengineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for \nundergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems \nEngineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have \nalso been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, \nIBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested \nto hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on \nplatforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to \nevaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.\n\n    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  \nMathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the \npackages are many notebooks (\"COSY_Notes\") which demonstrate  \nthe functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of \nmany fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books \nlisted in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have \nbeen collected from the various references given at the end of this \nfile. The contents of the notebooks in the \"COSY_Notes\" directory are \ngiven below.\n   \n ----------- Begin \"COSY_Notes\" Contents -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 01_Introduction.ma\n CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Control Systems\n\t\n\tSections:  \n\t     Analyticity\n\t     Poles and Zeros\n\t     Signals\n\t     Forward Laplace Transforms\n\t     Inverse Laplace Transforms\n\t     Differential Equation With Zero-Valued Initial Conditions\n\t     Differential Equation With Initial Conditions\n\t     \t     \n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 02_Math_Models.ma\n CHAPTER 2: Mathematical Modeling of Dynamic Systems\n\n \t Sections:  \n\t      ODE to State Space  \n\t      Linearization of a Nonlinear System of Equations  \n\t      State Space to Transfer Function\n\t\t     \n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_*_Transient_Response.ma\n CHAPTER 3: Transient-Response Analysis  \n            (Chapter split into three sub notebooks because of file\n\t     size)\n\n\t NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_1_Transient_Response.ma\n            \n\t    Sections :       \n\t      Time Response Analysis  \n\t      First order System  \n\t      Second Order System  \n\t      Third Order and Higher Order Systems\n\t      \n         NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_2_Transient_Response.ma\n            \n\t    Sections  :        \t      \n\t      First Order System (Step Response vs. Time Const)  \n\t      \n\t      \n         NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_3_Transient_Response.ma\n            \n\t    Sections  :\n\t      Second Order System (Step Response vs. Damping Ratio)  \n\t      \n\t            \n -----------\n\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 04_Steady_State_Response.ma\n CHAPTER 4: Steady-State Response\n \n         Sections:\t      \n\t      Routh's Stability \n \t      Steady-State Error Analysis\n                \n -----------\n\t\t\n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 05_Root_Locus.ma\n CHAPTER 5: Root-Locus Analysis\n\n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 06_Freq_Response.ma\n CHAPTER 6: Frequency-Response Analysis\n\n         Sections:\n\t      Bode Plot Analysis  \n\t      Magnitude vs. Phase Plot (Nichols Plot)\n\t      Polar Plot  \n\t      Nyquist Plot  \n\t      Combined Example\n\t      \n -----------\n \n NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 07_State_Space.ma\n CHAPTER 7: State Space Methods\n\n         Sections:\n\t      Introduction\n\t      State Transition Matrix\n\t      Controllability\n\t      Observability\n\t      Output Controllability\n\t      Pole Placement Design \n\t      Observer Design\n\t      Time Response Using State Space Methods\n\n \n ----------- End Notebook Contents -----------\n \n\n--> Compressed Files\n\n        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9\npackages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:\n\n COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     \t\tcompressed tar file for Unix systems\n\t\n COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     \tcompressed sit file for Macintosh \n \t\t\t\tsystems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 \n\t\t\t\tformat (requires the   shareware\n\t\t\t\t Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). \n\t\n COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    \tzip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS\n    \n     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on \nMacintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.\n\n\n--> Installation of COSY_PAK\n\n o In UNIX Command line type the following command:\n\n      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -\n\n o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware\n    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.\n  \n o In IBM Command line type the following command:\n\n      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip\n\nNOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0.

{"group": "comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware", "text": "From: jamesc@netcom.com (James Chuang)\nSubject: Re: Any info on Cyrix 486DRu2 chip?\nOrganization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)\nLines: 64\n\nIt seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible\n486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:\nAnd also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.\n\nThe 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX\nsocket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.\nthe 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any\nsoftware query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the\ncoproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the\nactual coprocessor.\n\nThe internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit\nrate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance\nboost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a\n386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and\nQAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,\nis about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is\naround the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,\nand DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2\ncompatibility, but I didn't test it.\n\nThe 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually\na small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains\nthe logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX\nPGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board\ndoubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when \naccess to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available\nfrom Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20\nonly.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.\nIf Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need\nto put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...\n\nI also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K\nexternal cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still\nsignificantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.\n\nIMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or\ncan't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,\nbut if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure\nabout the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't\nbeat it in any significant way.\n\nThe last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,\nasking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:\n\nTreasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.\n1-800-677-9781\nThe 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00\n\nBut....\n\nI liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.\nIf you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you\nmore info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,\nSo I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions\nregarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.\n\njamesc\n909-396-0408\n\n\n-- \n=========================================\nIf someone asks if you are a God, you say...

(What Microsoft means by \"Device Independent\" is unclear to\n    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit\n    pixels.\n\n    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.\n    If\tyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-\n    swap all short and long integer values.\n\n    By convention, DIB images end in the extension \".BMP\".   This  is  because\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 2 -\n\n\n    they  are  a  super-set of earlier \"bitmap image files\".  Consequently you\n    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as \"BMP\" files.\n\n    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three \"flavors\"  of  DIB\n    images:\n\t o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended\t convention,  and  the\n\t     form  which I will describe how to create.\t They are intended for\n\t     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.\n\t o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the\tflavor\n\t     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.\n\t o   Old-style Bitmap images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 3 -\n\n\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS\n\n    The DOS DIB images consist of:\n\t 1.  A \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\t as  a\n\t     DIB  file.\t  This\theader\talso gives the total size of the image\n\t     file, and the offset to the image data.\n\t 2.  A \"BITMAPINFOHEADER\"  image  header  which\t specifies  the\t image\n\t     attributes.\n\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,\n\t     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows\n\t     RGBQUAD structure.\n\t 4.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:\n\t 1.  The same \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\n\t     as\t a  DIB\t file.\t This  header also gives the total size of the\n\t     image file, and the offset to the image data.\n\t 2.  A \"BITMAPCOREHEADER\"  image  header  which\t specifies  the\t image\n\t     attributes.\n\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this\n\t     exists  it\t may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a\n\t     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.\n\t 4.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:\n\t 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.\t Which\theader\n\t     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.\n\t 2.  An optional color palette.\t  This\tpalette\t may  be  composed  of\n\t     either   Windows\tRGBQUAD\t  structures  (if  the\theader\twas  a\n\t     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the\theader\n\t     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).\n\t 3.  The image data itself.\n\n\n    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.\n\n    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward\tsteps.\n    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header\n    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  \"windows.h\"\tinclude\t file.\n    Palette  information  needs\t to  be\t stored for images that are not 24-bit\n    images.  The five general steps are:\n\t 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER\t  and\tthe   BITMAPINFOHEADER\n\t     structures the basic image information.\n\t 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,\t creating  the\n\t     color palette of RGBQUADS.\n\t 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 4 -\n\n\n\t     the \"bfSize\" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.\n\t 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the\tstart  of  the\n\t     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  \"bfOffBits\"\tfield  of  the\n\t     BITMAPFILEHEADER.\n\t 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,\tthe  BITMAPINFOHEADER,\n\t     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).\n\n    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C\t type-\n    defined  keywords.\tThe following table describes these keywords for those\n    not familiar with MicroSoft C.\n\n\t\t     _______________________________________\n\t\t    |\t\t\t\t\t   |\n\t\t    | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.|\n\t\t    |______________________________________|\n\t\t    | typedef |\t meaning\t\t   |\n\t\t    |_________|____________________________|\n\t\t    | BYTE    |\t unsigned character\t   |\n\t\t    | WORD    |\t two byte unsigned integer |\n\t\t    | DWORD   |\t four byte unsigned integer|\n\t\t    |_________|____________________________|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 5 -\n\n\n    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER\n\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\n\t typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {\n\t\t WORD\t bfType;\n\t\t DWORD\t bfSize;\n\t\t WORD\t bfReserved1;\n\t\t WORD\t bfReserved2;\n\t\t DWORD\t bfOffBits;\n\t } BITMAPFILEHEADER;\n\n    The \"bfType\" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.\t  This\tserves\n    to\tidentify  the  file  as\t a  DIB\t image file.  On an intel byte ordered\n    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed\tin  C  as  the\n    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.\n\n    The \"bfSize\" field is the total size of the file.  For our\tpurposes  this\n    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the\t color\tpalette\t times\n    the\t size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.\tIf the\n    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be\n    calculated\tahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in\n    later.\n\n    Both the \"bfReserved1\" and the \"bfReserved2\"  fields  are  always  set  to\n    zero.\n\n    The \"bfOffBits\" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data\n    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set\n    to:\t the  size  of\tthe   BITMAPFILEHEADER,\t  plus\t the   size   of   the\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times\n    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written\n    write after the color palette if one exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 6 -\n\n\n    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER\n\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\n\t typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{\n\t\t DWORD\t biSize;\n\t\t DWORD\t biWidth;\n\t\t DWORD\t biHeight;\n\t\t WORD\t biPlanes;\n\t\t WORD\t biBitCount;\n\t\t DWORD\t biCompression;\n\t\t DWORD\t biSizeImage;\n\t\t DWORD\t biXPelsPerMeter;\n\t\t DWORD\t biYPelsPerMeter;\n\t\t DWORD\t biClrUsed;\n\t\t DWORD\t biClrImportant;\n\t } BITMAPINFOHEADER;\n\n    The \"biSize\" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure\n    itself.   When  reading  the  image\t file,\tthis  value is what is used to\n    determine  that  the  image\t contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER\t and   not   a\n    BITMAPCOREHEADER.\n\n    The \"biWidth\" field is the width of the image in image pixels.\n\n    The \"biHeight\" field is the height of the image in image lines.\n\n    The \"biPlanes\" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out\n    as if there was one color plane.\n\n    The \"biBitCount\" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either\n    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.\n\n    The \"biCompression\" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is\n    compressed.\t   DIB\timages\tsupport\t two  forms  of\t run-length  encoding.\n    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how\n    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the\n    data is not compressed.\n\n    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to\n    zero.   A  requirement  of\tthe  interpretting software that it be able to\n    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.\n\n    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be \"biClrUsed\".\n    For\t 4-bit\tand  8-bit  images  this  field\t indicates that not all of the\n    possible color entries are used and that the  image\t contains  \"biClrUsed\"\n    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may\n    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set\n    this field to zero.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t      March 15, 1991\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t    - 7 -\n\n\n    COLOR PALETTES\n\n    Each entry of a  color  palette  is\t a  RGBQUAD  structure.\t  The  RGBQUAD\n    structure is defined in the \"windows.h\" include file as:\n\t typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbBlue;\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbGreen;\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbRed;\n\t\t BYTE\t rgbReserved;\n\t } RGBQUAD;\n    The \"rgbReserved\" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the\tamount\n    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is\n    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  \"rgbBlue\",  \"rgbGreen\",  or\n    \"rgbRed\"   fields  indicates  that\tthat  particular  component  does  not\n    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in\tany  of\t these\n    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully\t to  the color\n    composition.\n\n\n\n    IMAGE DATA\n\n    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data\tin  DIB\t image\n    file.   The\t creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and\n    certainly was.\n\n    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four\n    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel\n    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The\n    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:\n\n\t\t bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\n\n\t---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---\n\n\t\t bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\n\n\n    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.\n    The\t bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the\n    first line of image data in the file.\n\n    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written\tas  you\t would\n    expect.   One  bit\timages\tare  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit\n    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one\n    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.\n    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be\t written  out  in  the\n    order  blue,  green, red.

Hacking is\nwhat AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.\nthesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,\netc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.\nProducing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that\nnot many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.\n\nIn addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing\nrunning programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to\nproblem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.\nAt a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should\n'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -\nand I have to say I'm inclined to agree.\n\n(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.\nAnd I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)\n\n\n--\nPeter Jackson, Dept of Electrical & Computer Eng, Clarkson University\n\"Opinions expressed are not those of my employer or any other organization\"\nSecond Violin, Fiddling Firefighters Ensemble (Rome Branch)\n"}

This code,\nin modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.\n\n\n4) Converting color into grayscale.\n\nThe NTSC formula is:\n\n    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue\n\n\n5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.\n\nThe only reference you need for this stuff is:\n\n    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6\n\nBut before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation\nsoftware mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do\nsome form of gray to b&w conversion.\n\n\n6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.\n\nThe obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source\nimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.\nThis is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,\nloop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*\ntransformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.\nThis method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one\n2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing\nsub-pixel sampling.\n\nHowever, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,\nwhich involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally\ncreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is\nalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: \"A Fast Algorithm for Raster\nRotation\", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics\nInterface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in\nthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears\nin \"Graphics Gems\" (see section [1]) under the original title.\n\n\n7) Free image manipulation software.\n\nThere are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to\nanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus\nthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.\nHere are pointers to some of them:\n\n    xv by John Bradley.

See item 13 below for\ndetails on some.\n\nAlso, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion\nof software like this.  You may find useful information there.\n\n\n8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.\n\nYou almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on free\nimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and\nlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you\nwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the\nformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.\n\nThese files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.\nThis archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object\nformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark\nHall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.\n\nA second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained\nby Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at\nftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,\nneither of these is complete, you might want to check both.\n\nFITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most\noften used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images\nbut other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and\ninformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.\n\n\n\n9) Converting between vector formats.\n\nA lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw\nto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\nare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.\nThe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\nExcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\n\nThere is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The\ncontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.\nA better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\n\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\nAs far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\nconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive\nsite.\n\nA related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\nto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to\nX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for\nPC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,\nthe PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can\nbe used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the\nanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\ntrivial.\n\nGNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\na PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements\nessentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript\nand level 2).\n\n\n10) How to get Pixar films.\n\nThe various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available\non video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:\n\n    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price\n    Luxo, Jr.\t\t\t\t$14.95\t\t\t$50.00\n    Red's Dream\t\t\t\t$19.95\t\t\t$75.00\n    Tin Toy\t\t\t\t$24.95\t\t\t$75.00\n    Knickknack\t\t\t\t$24.95\t\t\t$75.00\n    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy\t$39.95\t\t\t$100.00\n\nAll tapes are on 1/2\" VHS NTSC.

Also\navailable:\n\n    Tin Toy T-shirt\t\t\t$15.00\n    Knickknack 3D T-shirt\t\t$15.00 (includes glasses)\n\nFor individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for\neach additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H\nfor the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add\n$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,\n213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify\nprices and availability.  Or, just write to:\n\n    Direct Cinema Limited\n    1749 14th Street\n    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342\n\nAllan Braunsdorf has this to say:\n\nAt SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts\nfor $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly\nmore than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's\navailable from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).\n\n    Pixar\n    1001 West Cutting Blvd.\n    Richmond, CA. 94804\n    (510) 236-4000 \n    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)\n\nYou can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains \"Luxo, Jr.\", \"Red's\nDream\", \"Tin Toy\" and \"Knicknack\" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They\nwill take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I \nordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect \nto be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license\nagreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.\n\n\n11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?\n\nThe short answer is, \"You can't.\"  Unless you use a rational spline you\ncan only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of\napproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to\ndo the job right, consult the article:\n\n  \"A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles\"\n  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller\n  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,\n  September, 1989, pages 48-56.\n\nFor rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:\n\n  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture\n  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,\n  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.\n\nFor the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:\n\n  \"Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves\"\n  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken\n  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),\n  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]\n\n\n12) How to order standards documents.\n\nThe American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also\nISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,\nmailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the\ncomplete name and number.\n\nSome useful numbers to know:\n\nCGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical\nKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical\nInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI\nY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;\nfor example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.\n\nStandards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit\ncomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let\nyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering\nat 1-800-854-7179.\n\n\n13) How to FTP by email.\n\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\n\nIn addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use\nit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\n\n\n14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\n\nConsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\ninfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\nthe point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in\nthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in\nGlassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\ntreatment of special cases.\n\nAnother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\nthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\n\nCode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\nthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:\npub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.\n\n\n15) How to tessellate a sphere.\n\nOne simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The\nbase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides\neach triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>\nhas posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.\nIt's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.\n\n16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.\n\nRick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:\n\nHighlights of this edition-\n\n    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through\n       November '91;\n    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG\n        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;\n    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;\n    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;\n    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.\n\nThe bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.\nBelow is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named\n\"speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z\" and is compressed at most sites-\n\n             Site                             Dir\n\twuarchive.wustl.edu\tgraphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/\n\tkarazm.math.uh.edu\tpub/Graphics/\n\tgondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au\tpub/papers/\n\tnic.funet.fi\t\tpub/sci/papers/graphics\n\tcoral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/\n\nEric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global\nillumination bibliographies.

This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both\nanonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.\n\nThe anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes\nboth conference and publications subdirectories.\n\nTo retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to\n     archive-server@siggraph.org\nand in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send\nfollowed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with\nthe command\n     send index\nwhich will give you an up-to-date list of available information.\n\n\n18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available\n\n[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]\n\nACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings\nat the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available\nin three formats:\n     text   (ASCII)\n     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)\n     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)\nThey may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:\n\n(1) by anonymous ftp\n    change to one of the directories\n       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]\n    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word\n    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary \n    mode.\n\n    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the\n    contents of each panel file.\n\n(2) by electronic mail\n    send mail to\n       archive-server@siggraph.org\n    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.

Comments - 26 formats, no software\n      (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).\n      Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.\n\n\n21) What about GIF?\n\nGIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon\na wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\nkeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like\nit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question\nwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list\nof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.\n\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info\nNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,\n\talt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,\n\talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers\n\nAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from\npit-manager.mit.edu in the files:\n\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\n\nAlso available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail\nmessage containing any or all of:\n\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\n\nSend a message containing \"help\" to get general information about the\nmail server.\n\nAlso, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and\n20 above for more information.\n\n\n22) What is morphing?\n\nWarping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new\nlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.\nValerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and\nmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au\nin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:\n\n        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)\n        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)\n        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)\n\nThe files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and\nuncompress them afterwards.\n\n\n23) How to ray-trace height fields\n\nHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,\nsuch as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they\nget their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be\nlocated via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.\n\nThe following paper seems to be the definitive reference:\n\nF. Kenton Musgrave\nGrid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields\nJuly, 1988\n<musg88.ps.Z>\n\nThis is available as \"Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639\" from Yale University,\nit's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and\nImaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:\n\n    nic.funet.fi\t\tpub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z\n    weedeater.math.yale.edu\tpub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z\n    princeton.edu\t\tpub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z\n    coral.cs.jcu.edu.au\t\tgraphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z\n    gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU\tpub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z\n\nAn implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.\n\nAnother paper exists:\n\n%A David W. Paglieroni\n%A Sidney M. Petersen\n%T Parametric Height Field Ray Tracing\n%J Proceedings of Graphics Interface '92\n%I Canadian Information Processing Society\n%C Toronto, Ontario\n%D May 1992\n%P 192-200\n\nAnd still one more:\n\nMusgrave, Kolb, and Mace\n\"The Synthesis and Rendering of Eroded Fractal Terrains\",\nComputer Graphics Vol 23, No. 3 (SIGGRAPH '89 procedings) p. 41-50\n\n\n\n24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon\n\n\tThe area of a triangle is given by (in C notation),\n\n     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -\n\t            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );\n\nand the area of a planar polygon is given by\n\n     area = 0.0;\n\n     for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )\n         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );\n     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );\n     area /= 2.0;\n\nIf the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is\nclockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.\n\n>From Ronald Golman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above), \"Area\n of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:\"\n\nThe area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is\ngiven by\n\n     Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |\n\nwhere N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal\nvertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x\nrepresents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation\noperator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal\nto P0.\n\n\n25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH\n\nProbably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your\nlocal technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.\nSomewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.\nFill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,\nVoting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)\n\nSIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for\nVoting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions\non Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or\nAssociate Members.\n\nIf you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you\n$59.00 (no student discount).\n\nThere are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.\n\nACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. \nTheir phone number is (212) 626-0500.

This may include the ability for the system to fully power down\nthe monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on\nautomatically.  (Is this a \"sell\" on screen saver software companies?)\n\nGoals for \"idle\" power consumption have been set at something like 30\nwatts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on\nthis).\n\nNote that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,\nespecially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.\nSun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for\nthe night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per\nyear.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would\nprobably have greater than double that value.\n\nGiven that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and\nhome computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),\nbuilding power consumption control into all machines has a potential to\ncut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.\n\nBTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving\nwork, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors\nwith the power switch on front.  There was some indication that\nmonitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate\nlots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, but\nmight be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch\nin back.\n\n\n"}

Advice wanted...\nOrganization: University of Western Ontario, London\nNntp-Posting-Host: vega.irus.rri.uwo.ca\nLines: 81\n\n\nHi:\n\nI need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!\nI want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  \n\n     -\tEditing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)\n\n     -\tCreating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)\n\n     -\tEditing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under \n\tWindows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel\n\n     -\tUsing the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, \n\ttalking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of\n\tthe images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.\n\nI've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,\nand decided that a \"nice\" system (price/performance) would be:\n\n\t486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus\n\t15\" monitor, 1280x1024 NI\n\t3Com Etherlink III 16bit\n\tMaxtor 240MB IDE hard drive\n\nHowever, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these\ntogether, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise\nsurprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even\nhave a 50MHz local bus running...\n\nI have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\nthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\nthat I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any \nspeedy help would be appreciated even more!!)\n\n\n\nBTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following \nconfiguration:\n\n\t486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram\n\t14\" monitor, 1024x768 NI\n\tSMC Ethercard 8 bit\n\tMaxtor 120MB IDE hard drive\n\nWe're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\nbeen uncovered!  \n\nThere doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\nrunning the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\na long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\nThere's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\ndon't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\nmedium size images.\n\nI have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\nmachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \non the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\ntransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \nimages).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\nmake a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n(above), for that reason.\n\nAlso, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!\n\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\n\n-----\nRoss Mitchell, Imaging Research Lab, |   rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca\nJohn P. Robarts Research Institute   |\nP.O.

If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)\n\nHere is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the\npathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story\nbut would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the\npotential pitfalls of \"upgrading\" to DOS 6 that I have been able to\nnotice after only about a week of playing around with it.\n\nMy envorinment\n==============\n\nTI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk\nSystem BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments\nCL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel\nAdvance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments\nSmart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-\nWindows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs\n\nAfter \"updgrading\" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things\nbecame so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the\nprocess of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.\n\n\nDisk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive\n==================================================\n\nWhile most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain\napplications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is\nthat commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to\nconsider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)\nand decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).\n\nThe Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from\nfactory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when \"upgraded\" to\nDOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of\nmore than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew\nthat DS compression must cost something.\n\nSpecifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually\n*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than\nI/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings\nin I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large\nrandom writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.\n\nWhile the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or\nsequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on\nWinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.\n\nThe tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv\non, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective\nstatements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or\neven that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and\nslow disk I/O'.\n\nThis explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why\n'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.\n\n\nDouble Space and Windows\n========================\n\nDBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you\nwanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that\nmatter even check on its usage -- try \"fasthelp dblspace\" in a dos box\nwithin windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you\nget.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.\n\nYes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to\nfile manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed\nfloppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed\nfloppy if you dont know how to.)\n\n\nDOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM\n==============================================\n\nDefragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited\npatiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.\nThis confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take\nno more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)\nbut it took 12 minutes.\n\nI discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran\nfaster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this\nhad to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)\nmodule which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,\nand it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After\ndisabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.\n\n\nMicrosft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots\n====================================================================\n\nIn the readme.txt file, you can find the the following\n\n\tRunning Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers\n\t----------------------------------------------------------------\n\tTo avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup\n\tfor Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in\n\tyour CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you\n\trun Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.\n\nIf you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it\nmeans \"disable all power saving features of your notebook\".  Why would\nanyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only\ndoes TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the\nreadme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what\nelse) are crippled by the TI's power saver.\n\nIt is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If\nthere indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI\nprogrammers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have\nto guess as to who are the idiots.\n\nBy the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE\nin DOS6, when you check the status, it says:\n\n\tPower Management Status\n\t-----------------------\n\tSetting =  ADV: MAX\n\tCPU: idle 60% of time.\n\nThis figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook\nwhen I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in\niconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all\nfor itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is\nsuch an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating\nsystem or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%\nidle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type\nof package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'\nexample of our times!\n\n\nMicrosoft programmers do not know batch programming\n===================================================\n\nI like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of\naddpath statements like this:\n\n\tset PATH=C:\\DOS\n\t...\n\tset PATH=C:\\ETC\\BIN;%PATH%;C:\\BIN\n\t...\n\tset PATH=C:\\ETC\\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\\WINDOWS\n\t...\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\BCC\\BIN\n\t...\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n\nEven though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old\none (i.e. c:\\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every\npath statement, and prepends C:\\DOS to its value.  As a result, my\nresultant path has so many DOS's.\n\nIf the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add\nthe new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement\ncontaing the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.\n(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a\ndirectory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)\n\nInstead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)\ndecided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and\nprepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it\nwould not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.\n\nI started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft\nrepresentative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he\nspecifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the\ninformation to him as he did not have access to internet.\n\nNow that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement\nwith %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement\nshould not be touched for any reason?\n\nAs another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to\nunderstand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:\n\n\tset MOUSE=C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n\tloadhigh %MOUSE%\\MOUSE.COM\n\nGuess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with\n\n\tLH ... C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\\MOUSE.COM\n\nWhy is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its\nparameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.\n\n\nDOS 6 Software Quality\n======================\n\nDOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,\nyou end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the\ncommands that come with it.\n\nI am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to\nuse all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont\nwithin a week, I will post how you can create this \"ghost\" file.\n\nSurely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a\nparticular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)\nprogrammers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find\nit -- that is what I was told how Microsoft \"tests the quality\" of\ntheir products.\n\nI think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to \"test quality\"\nwhen it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but\ncan only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any\nform of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs\nthat will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond\nrepair!\n\nAlso, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk\nis fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the\ndefragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated\nwhen I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive\ndefragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and\nwith no new file creation since.\n\nMicrosft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you\nadmit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we\nshould watch out for if we have already used DS.\n\nJaya\n\n--\nDr. Jayasooriah  CSE, CS&E, UNSW | Sign in a Paris hotel:                    \nP.O.

The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.\n  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or\n    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our\n    European friends.\n  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.\n  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring\n    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,\n    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).\n  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale \n    or color on a Color monitor.)\n  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that\n    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)\n  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution\n    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).\n\n    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people\n    are encouraged to use in other programs.\n\n    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:\n        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n\n\nFrom the ghostscript README:\n\n*****************************************************\n* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *\n*****************************************************\n\n********\n******** An overview of Ghostscript ********\n********\n\nGhostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:\n\n        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very\nclosely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and\n\n        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that\nimplement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive\noperations in the Ghostscript language.\n\nThe Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely\nin C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.\nCurrently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform\nfamilies:\n\n        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible\n          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;\n\n        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,\n          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,\n          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;\n          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX\n          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;\n          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;\n\n        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;\n\n        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler\n          version 3.1 or later is required).\n\n\n(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)\n\n-- \nTim Williams                                   COM: (703) 704-1685\nNight Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate  DSN: 654-1685\nAMSEL-RD-NV-VISPD (Williams)                   FAX: (703) 704-1705\nFt.

Also built around the Athena Text Widget it\nfeatures, amongst other things,\n\n   o multiple windows\n   o multiple buffers\n   o default menu interface\n   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons \n     under user control\n   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters\n   o provision for defining a keyboard macro\n   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters\n   o file selection via a browser\n   o knowledge of line numbers\n   o parenthesis matching\n   o regular expression searching\n   o restricted or unlimited undo\n   o ability to change font\n   o easy entry of control codes\n   o xterm-like keymap feature\n   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)\n   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help\n   o server mode with cooperating client programs\n   o optional extension language using Tcl\n   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability\n   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe\n\nI have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and\nXaw3d options, on the following systems:\n\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5\n   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5\n   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5\n   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5\n   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5\n   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5\n   \nbut not all have been subject to the same level of testing.

I have not bothered to try this version under\nR4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known\nproblems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If\nit doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,\n2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as\nmany features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only\nthat, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of\naXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2\nnever got converted to make use of it.\n\naXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)\nand arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due\ncourse from several other ftp sites.

My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nSimple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be\nsome confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use\nthe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it\nis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.\n\nHere is an example.  For some time, I was short of \"free interrupts.\"  I had a\ntape controller (not a \"floppy tape\") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an\n*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my\nmodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and\nthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt\nhandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate\nan interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape\ncontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would\nmost likely \"hang.\")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it\ninstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for\nthe serial port.\n\nUnder DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the\nstatus of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.\nThat's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.\nTry that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)\n-- \nKenneth R.

For instance, the command\n\nxfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).\n\nThe command  \n\nxfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).\nDespite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can\ngenerate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a\nresolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.\n\nIs this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can\ndo to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about\nmy resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).\nThis would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to\nlook at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: \"Yup, thats\nan inch\".

Those\n>who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm\n>looking for.\nI have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare\nthe files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or \nsimilar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,\nshow the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be\ninvoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very\nconvenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to\nbe performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the\nprogram vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files\nI use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to\nuse arbitrary viewers to show special data formats.

Asher) writes:\n|> I've been getting mail from Xhibition about the June conference and I was\n|> wondering if Microsoft had bought Xhibition?  The front says \"Conference\n|> from Microsoft Windows NT Developers\".  What's the deal?  I thought\n|> \"X\"hibition was for \"X-windows\"??\n|> \n|> -- \n|>       Jesse W. Asher                                          \n\nYes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference \nremains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full\nand half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days\nprovide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor\nexhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what\nfolks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.\n\nSpeakers at Xhibition 93 include: \n\n  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, \n  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, \n  Doug Young, and many others.\n\nXhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional\nconferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of\ninterest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object\nManagement Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server\ntechnologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;\nand (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.\n\nWith the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing\napplications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a\nplayer as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many\ndesktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be\nevaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and\nsuppliers.\n\nThe mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information\nto the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference\nat Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide\nthe *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX\ndevelopers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has\nwhat you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is\nthe place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you\nwhat you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development\nKits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an\nXhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience\nis growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a\nconfusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of\nthe other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.\n\n\n-Aub Harden\n Technical Program Manager\n harden@ics.com\n\n\n        X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade\n         ******    *****    Show for Corporate\n        *      *       *    Software Development\n         ******     ***  \n             *         *    201 Broadway\n          ***     *****     Cambridge, MA  02139\n\n              Windows on Distributed Computing\n\n                 June 7 - 11,   San Jose, CA\n\n           xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit\n        Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555\n\n      Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc.\n"}

I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these\ndo indeed copy these tags.\n\nHas anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?\nI have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but\nthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I\nhope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer\nto find code already known to work in xv.\n-- \n:s \n:s Larry W.

I'm glad we (MS) are starting\nto remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future \nreleases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the \nmid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over\nthe world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS\n(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.\nThe theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people\nuntil they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the \nwayside.\n\nThen Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to\nbe doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either\nstayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that\npoint in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the\nshort term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS\n3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.\nVersion 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will\noffer even more in terms of \"real\" OS features (I work on NT and have no\nreal clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do\nknow that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a\nfew years ago).\n\n\t...Dave\n\nOf course these are my opinions. If you want MS's opinions, as a PR person.\n"}
