It can reduce the amount of insulin you\nhave to take.  \"High blood pressure\" - I have never heard of this claim\nbefore.  \"... anabolic steroids\" - I have also never heard of this claim\nbefore.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth\nfor God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?\n\n\n\n|>  On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place\n|> bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...\n\n\n\nI agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely\nto make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component\nof an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an\nimportant contribution to good health.  It is important to\nexercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).\n\nChromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase\nlean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the\nstatistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.\n\nChromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of\nthe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role\nin \"sensitizing\" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.\nWeight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity\nto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose\nweight (4).\n\nInsulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards\nprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This \"protein sparing\"\neffect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets\nas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle\nand organ tissue.  By \"sensitizing\" muscle to insulin,\nchromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters\nso that they \"burn\" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation\nof lean body mass has an important long-term positive\neffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the\nfat they've lost.\n\nChromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding\nthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.\nInsulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability\nof food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin \nstimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say\nthat chromium picolinate increases metabolism.\n\nIn summary, you need to change your life style in order to\nloose weight and stay healthy:\n\n  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.\n     - Eating fat makes you fat.\n\n  B. Increase dietary fiber\n     - low in calories; high in nutrients.\n\n  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week\n     - burn calories.\n\n  D. Take chromium picolinate daily\n     - lose fat; keep muscle\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \n       =================================================================     \n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \n\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \n      ==================================================================\n                                April 20, 1993 \n      ==================================================================\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \n(Kolata, Gina) \n\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \nMaddox. \n      ================================================================== \n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \net al.) \n\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \nconclude. \n      ==================================================================    \n                                April 21, 1993 \n      ==================================================================    \n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \n(04/21/93), P. 7A \n\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \ntogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies \ninvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, \nEli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, \nSyntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The \nparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they \nwere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  \ninvolved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the \ncollaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong \nscientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nand early clinical data.

Following recent  highly publicized reports of \nhealth professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revised \nguidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief \nMedical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care \nworkers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV  \ninfection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.

As I understand it,\nthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally\nhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki\nring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,\nif I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,\nfood occasionally gets \"stuck\" before reaching my stomach. This results\nin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.\nFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,\nand causes frequent discomfort.\n\nMy doctor wants to \"dilate\" the ring using the\nfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach\nfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing\nsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know\nif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,\nwas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on\nsafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become\na common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding\nprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,\nespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,\nreaction to anesthesia).\n\nThe second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number\nof \"extra\" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there\nhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24\nhrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,\nhowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist\nindicated that such a number was \"normal\". It certainly doesn't\nfeel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of\nextended \"runs\" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause\nsevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good\nhealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or\ncaffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as \"normal\", but don't\nwant to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number\nof PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something\nas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying\ndown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly\nbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the\nsame time.\n\nThanks for any help/advice!\n\n\n===============================================================================\n===============================================================================\n"}

If neither the output or\ninput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively\ncoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and\nfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any\ncoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.\n\nIf the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than\njust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before\nswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.\n\nIf you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input\nthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching\nwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch\nchange. This may mask the switch click.\n\nAn audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and\nmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)\nsealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles\nuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes\na complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.\nRadio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.\n\nFor a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try \nlooking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its\nolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed\nprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete\nand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).\nAll the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily\nmake a subject for a multi-page article.\n\nSolid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on\ndue to charge being injected into the audio line through device\ncapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to\nminimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through\nthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the\ncontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as\nputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.\n\nHope this helps at least get you started.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\n"}

My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the\npossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in\n1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book\nbecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written\nfrom a scientific viewpoint.

Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book\nfor kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about\n40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic\nboxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of\nthe scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few\nmoments in the life of the scientist, \"What I was doing when I was 12\",\nSo you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There \nwill be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph\nbiographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing\nwill then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added\nrichness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may\nalso be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in\nCanada as well.\n \nI am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close \nto being it.

My doctor started using one recently, and I\nthought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  \n\nThe thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.\nThe ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point\nthe thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear\nto straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then\npushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.\nIt is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on \nyourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,\nand may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  \n\nI talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,\nand she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give\nme some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion\nfeels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly\non one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to\nthe company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company\nhad told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end\nof the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior\nto reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree\nof the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.\n\nI have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the\nprobe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you\nhave to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button\nto get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect\nthat many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for\nyet another reason.\n\nIn short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe\nit doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.\n\n"}

Clarke\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\nOrig. Ed. 1993\nPre-publication $84.50\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\n\n\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\nreach them.   \n\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\n\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\nfictional\n\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\narchives\n\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\n\nABOUT RON MILLER\n\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high\nspots.]\n\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's\nNational Air and Space Museum\n\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\nSmithsonian* magazine\n\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\n\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \n\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\n\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\n\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\n\nORDERING INFORMATION\n\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nPO Box 9542\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\nUSA\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\nFax (407)951-3671\n\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\nadditional book.  \n\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\nadditional.

If you want to protect you soft, supply a\n>good documentation and support. This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively \n>protecting software.\n\nThere are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the\nuser is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is\nfor the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on\n(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different\nmachine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  \n\nThe program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends\non the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user \ndid an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.\nNo document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!\n\nI did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's \nconscience should do that.\n\nI know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of \"casual\"\nusers who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights\n(It's the truth.  I have \"friends\" who ask me for copies of my latest games\nall the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual\npirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will\ndiscourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my \"friends\" dug up\nsomewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual\nrelease!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable\nthe quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined\npirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread \nthat far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once\nfound by authorities.  It is the \"casual\" pirates that the copy protection is\ndetermined to discourage.\n\nWhat I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus\na special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup\n\"REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip\" and disables the above.\nTwo benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and\nmakes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is\nencrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a\nstable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus\nviolated their license agreement.\n\nThis way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal \ndiscomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only\nproblem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.\n\nThe registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore\ngains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,\nthe software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is \nsupposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not \nsupposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,\na hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?\n\n--Kasey Chang\n"}

I would appreciate any comments about this and other\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\n\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\nout in 'noisy' situations.\n\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\n\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\noff a cliff).\n\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \n\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\nUSA\n"}

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \n    for the planet Venus. \n\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \n\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \n\n        The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\n    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\n\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus' \n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\n\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \n    across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.\n\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes' \n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \n\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \n    probes maintained that distinction.\n\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\n\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\n    gas to perform the operation.  \n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\n\n        Venus by Balloon\n\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of \n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \n    the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\n\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\n\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \n\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \n\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \n    encounter.\n\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\n    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \n    comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \n\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\n\n        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \n    location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\n\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\n    successfully arrived. \n\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\n    permeated the planet's atmosphere. \n\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \n    had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\n\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\n    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \n\n        Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \n    miles) above the surface. \n\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's \n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\n\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\n    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\n\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \n    over the last seven years.\n\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\n    bodies with one space vessel.\n\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \n    miles) towards the surface.\n\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \n    through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer \n    failed to function.\n\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\n    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \n    rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in \n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\n\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \n    hours.\n\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\n\n        Future Plans Diverted\n\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\n    the early 1990s.\n\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's \n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \n    the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to \n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\n\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\n    Mars' largest moon, Phobos. \n\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\n\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\n    landing in March of 1989. \n\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \n\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\n\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \n    make money.  \n\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\n\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \n\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\n\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \n    probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.\n\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\n    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\n    that violent atmosphere.\n\n        On the Drawing Boards\n\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\n\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\n    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\n\n        Humans on Venus      \n\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\n    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \n    to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\n    if not millennia.\n\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\n\n        Bibliography -\n\n         Barsukov, V.

Many different observations, including IRAS\n> and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures\n> can range from 40K to 150K.\n\nInterstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\"\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\nthe energy they have absorbed.\n\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\nby any conceivable observation.\n\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\n\"average\" temperature.\n\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\n\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\nAllen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\ncooked if that were the case.

{"group": "sci.electronics", "text": "From: wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (Bill Mayhew)\nSubject: Re: Laser vs Bubblejet?\nOrganization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine\nLines: 90\n\nThere is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers\navailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\n\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\n\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\nservice center for further information.\n\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\n\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\n\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\n\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\nproblem.\n\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\nlaserjet IV.\n\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\n\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\n\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\n\n\n-- \nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED\n"}

Given:\n\n1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,\nand the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clients\nreally do want that level of security\n\n2. These same people want to keep P a secret\n\nI find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P\nlying around.\n\n(I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small\npart of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in\nC her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find\nthis at least as surprising.)\n\nBack to the question:\n\nIf I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I\nwould also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up\nthe next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original\nquestion basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the\nmessage with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,\nand I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the following\nfor discussion.\n\nAlice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to\nshare, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by\nknowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they\nCORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to\nbe created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not\nknow which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,\nshe would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.\n\nWhat is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.\n(Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't\nhave exactly the same effect).\n\nNow, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC\ncomputed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):\n  1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S\n  2. break C2 into n-bit chunks\n  3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)\n  4. for i in each chunk sequentially\n       set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]\n\nAt the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.\n\n(Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the\nplaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in\nthe same manner.)\n\nNLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplest\nnon-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed\n(even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table\ncalled Sbox, and use:\n  x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].\n\nPractically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve never\nsees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid\nsubstitution on it.\n\nAlso practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32\nbits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might\nwork on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detail\nfor the discussion at hand.\n\nWho will be first to point out my errors, or give me a pointer to some\nliterature?\n--\nGreg Rose                 Australian Computing and Communications Institute\nggr@acci.com.au                                              +61 18 174 842\n`Use of the standard phrase \"HIJACKED\" may be inadvisable' -- CAA\n"}

So the\n  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \n  in three thousand to be cost-effective. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUntil now, phones have happened to allow the existence of \"wiretaps\",\ndetectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\ntime, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\naid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\ntechnologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\nprivate communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\nliterally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\nmicrophones at either end.\n\nIn order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\nphone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\nthat it had developed and begun manufacturing a special \"wiretap\" chip\nto be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\nwhich have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\nannounced it would use these chips \"in all its secure telephone\nproducts\".\n\nEach chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\nbe given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\neach conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\ninfo in a special \"law enforcement block\".  Law enforcement officers\nwith a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\nindentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\non any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\n\nTo date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\nsecurity.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, and\nmany suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\nhas claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\ninspire confidence on this point [1].\n\nHowever, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\nwhether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\ninvestigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\ninvestigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\ngive police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\nOr to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\neach wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\nof forcing phones to support wiretaps?\n\nTo start to answer this question, we might compare the current\nbenefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\ncosts of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\nbenefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\n\nWIRETAP BENEFITS\n\n1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\n[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\nrequests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\nwith the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\nresulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\nwiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\n76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\nregarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\nauthorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\ncalls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\naverage of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\nreporting costs), mostly for labor.\n\nThus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\nabout 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\nleast four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\ngets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\ntotal 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\nyear spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\nexpenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone \"access\"\nlines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\nphone line, or about two cents a month.\n\nIn general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\nof a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\nexpected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\nwiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\nthe same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\nwiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hidden\nmicrophones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\nmight focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\nwe might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\n\nIf we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\non average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\nbenefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\nof two cents a month per phone line.\n\nWIRETAP COSTS\n\nLet us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\nencryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\nhave offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\nears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\ndomestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\nadditional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\n\nExtra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\nincreasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\nbe used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\nthese keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\nThe chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\ndesign is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\nprocess so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\n(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\nlots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\nwiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\n\nPerhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\nreplace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\nbe represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\nwidely believed that governments are less efficient than private\nenterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\nperform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\nstandards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\nthey pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \n\nCurrently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\nU.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\naccess line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\nmonth, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\nas much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\nAnd this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because\ntheir encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\nwouldn't have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\nper phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGiven this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\nphone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\nslightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\nWhen the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\nattach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\nBut when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\nclearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\nwould really be less than the benefits.  \n\nIf consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a\ncompromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\nrate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\nnationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\n\n[1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6\n\n[2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the\n    Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,\n    Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.\n\n[3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.  \n\n[4] Dorothy Denning, \"The Clipper Chip: A Technical Summary\",\n    distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993. \n-- \nRobin Hanson  hanson@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov \n415-604-3361  MS-269-2, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035\n510-651-7483  47164 Male Terrace, Fremont, CA  94539-7921 \n"}

Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did \ndefinitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it\nwas Descartes who said that \"All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.\"\n\nIf I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances\nin human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.\nThis is so much the case that many simply refer to him as \"the philosopher\".\n\nRegarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his\nideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful\nthat his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years\nfrom now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.\n\nAs for \"modern\" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most\ninfluential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who\ncame after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and \namplified them over time).\n\nI would say that the most influential \"american\" philosopher would have to\nbe Dewey.\n\nBut as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in\n500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect\nwas \"American\", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.\n\n--Brian\n"}

At this point,  many\ncongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,\nfor a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best\npossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\nAct.                      \n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\nAmerica back to the Moon.\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\nspring, 1993.\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\nby necessity, must choose.                    \n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\nand politicians.\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\nSociety).\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n"}

In my\nview the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is\nsecret, leading to suspicion that there is a back door.  Without complete\ndisclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled, no matter how many trusted\nexperts are allowed to look at it in isolation.\n\nIs it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm?  The only\nconcern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build\nClipperphones without registering the keys.  Assume F can really be kept\nsecret as the Government assumes.  Then as part of the initial connection,\na Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate\nthat they both know F.  For example, the initiating phone picks a number Q\nand sends E[Q; F].  The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F], and the initiator\nsends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a\nrandom 64-bit block.  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so\nit can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential\nnumbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial\nnumbers of subsequent challenges.  This way Clipperphones will talk only\nto other Clipperphones.  Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own\nproprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that\nthey won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture?

It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295\ndown to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I got\npneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well;\ncholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized\nover time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch\nto Mevicore.  \n\nOn Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108, \nand HDL was 35; but the trig's were still\nvery high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, \nSGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).\n\nHe said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him\nconcern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol\nfigures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal (\"Just\nto be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem.\"),\nand wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might\nbe the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what\nI want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of.\n\nShould the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens to\nfolks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the above\nresults?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenient \nside effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected my \nliver, too).\n"}

On\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\n\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\n      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\n      levels of stress.\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\n      growing lack of support services for people who don't have\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\n      The \"quality\" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\n\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\nprotections for public employees.\n   \"More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\ncoverage for public employees,\" said McEntee.  \"This, despite the\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.\"\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\nsevere.\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\nhave no OSHA coverage.\n -30-\n--\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\n416-629-7000/629-7044\n"}

Address all letters to his address, given at the end\nof this document.\n     -- Russell\n\n  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA\n                     TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987\n\n\n     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer\ntechnology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-\ncles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\nhis \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\nlongings if it beeps.\n\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\n\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\nmerit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\nscribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\n\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\nget.)\n\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\n\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\ncalled \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\ncaptured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\ntrue one.\n\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\nX-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\nwill  have  totally demolished government's control over in-\nformation transfer.\n\n     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\ntremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\ncomputer now in existence.\n\n     The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\n(q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\nother factor  y.\n\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\nyield the original number started with.\n\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\nit  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\nan encrypted message, namely\n                       x\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\n\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\nital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\nyour pq)  and send that.\n\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\nsend this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\ny).\n\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\nweren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\n\n     Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\nthem  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\n\n     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\nwould consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\n\n     But  there's  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\nsimply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what's not\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\n\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\nwas called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\nwhat  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\nwar--the government against its own people?\"\n\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\n\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\nexists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\nin the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\ndown to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.\n\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\nsome  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\nously  can't  use  the  altruists'  \"other-directedness\"  of\n\"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\n\"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\nand say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\nnoble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\nchildren are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-\nally  live under egoism\"--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And\nof course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\nthen.\n\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\ntical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\nunilaterally.\n\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\nthe saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\nand moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I\nshall therefore repeat it now:\n\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\nfor a lifetime.\n\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\na  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\n\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\nbeggars as we may encounter.\n\n     But consider:\n\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\nthat  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\n\"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\ndiminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\nthermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's\nanarchy!\n\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\nously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\nthought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\n\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\nthis tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\n\"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\nhaps even other motives.)\n\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\nyour \"cause,\" you're not about to mount a military campaign,\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\nhundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\nyour mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\nUnfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\n\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\n\n     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\nfreedom for ourselves.\n\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\nit does indicate how government thinks.\n\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\nrailroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\nfor his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\ndrug.\n\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\nperfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\nself.\n\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\ndespair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\nbefore  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\nthat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-\nself free.\n\n     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,\nyou are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake\nname  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the\nmailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any\nfriends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested\nare welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-\naddressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-\nbels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared\nwith  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you\nshould have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to\nplug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.\nEven if you want to be the proverbial \"free rider\" and  just\nbenefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:\nEverything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or\ngive it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can\nget  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to\ngive it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist\nprofit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles\nshould make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly\nwilling to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-\nture.\n\n     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't\nlearn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they\noutlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before\nthey outlaw plowshares too.\n\n                                       --Chuck Hammill\n\n                                 THE LIBERTECH PROJECT\n                                 3194 Queensbury Drive\n                               Los Angeles, California\n                                                 90064\n                                          310-836-4157\n\n                                    hammill@netcom.com\n\n[The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992, with the\n permission of Chuck Hammill, by Russell Whitaker]\n\nThose interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate\nin at least these newsgroups:\n\n                alt.privacy\n                alt.security.pgp\n                comp.org.eff.talk\n                sci.crypt\n\nA copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program, PGP 2.1 (Pretty\nGood Privacy), can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world.\nOne such site is gate.demon.co.uk, where an MS-DOS version can be had by\nanonymous ftp as pgp22.zip in /pub/pgp.\n\nVersions for other operating systems, including UNIX variants\nand Macintosh, are also available.

All the clamor \nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\n\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \nwarrented.\n\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \nrestricting calcium intake.\n\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans \nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \ninfections should decline.\n\nMarty B.\n"}

Yes, you can use interaction with the\nEarth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential\napplications for this.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't\ncoming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy\nof your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where\nthis is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion\nis useful only in special situations, however.\n\nWhat you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,\nand run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy\n*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.\n\nIf you want more information, trying looking up \"electrodynamic propulsion\",\n\"tether applications\", and \"magsails\".\n\n>Can the idea of a \"dragless\" satellite be used in part to create the\n>electrical field?\n\nNo.  A \"dragless\" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel\nconstantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*\nthere was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around \"dragless\".\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"}

Also, don't\nbe afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest\nand positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,\nsorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.

Some wonder whether or not the moon could\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\n\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\nam not a diving expert).\n\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?\n\nken\nkhayash@hsc.usc.edu\n"}

Since we have to trust the escrow companies\nanyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from\nrandom seeds entered by the escrow agents.  And since the algorithm for\nkey-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an\nagent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, and\nrun his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is\nwhat is actually being put onto the floppies.\n\nAnd yes, there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could\nbe hard to check.  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each\ntime.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by\nthe trusted escrow agents.

{"group": "sci.electronics", "text": "From: camter28@astro.ocis.temple.edu (Carter Ames)\nSubject: Lead ACid Batteries PART 2!!!\nOrganization: Temple University\nLines: 40\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.ocis.temple.edu\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\n\n   I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post.\n\nSome more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.\n\n  One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  \nThey were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding\nlawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the \nriding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries \nwas new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered\nthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all\nworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced \nabout halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored\nin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)\n  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.\none is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and\ndiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries\ndead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said \"HMMMMMMMM\" and \nthe amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)\nthe internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They\nwere the same.  \n   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead\nacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only\nneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them\nby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they\nworked fine for around 25 of 'em. \n  This leads me to believe one of several things.\n     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)\n     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the\n        batteries.\n     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the \n          room where the concrete is, \n     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air\n         better than concrete.\n\n(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  \n\n   Any other ideas?\n    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*\n \n"}

Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no \n\t   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.\n\n\t2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid \n\t   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.\n\n\t3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has \n\t   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by \n\t   the NCI.\n\nThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should \nnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of \nwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal \nagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be \nhaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of \ncommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to \nrelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,\nothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a \nchance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the \nhealer's oath, \"I will do no harm\".  But you know David that very few \ntreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a \nvery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each \nphysician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some \nare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive \napproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long \nas the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake \nin lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in \nthe medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as \nquacks or even unethical.\n\nWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  \nThese people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the \nfrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are \nreally doing a pretty good job of providing \"alternative\" medicine.  But \nmany lack any formal training and are in the \"business\" simply to make a \nfew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting \ncompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative \ncare area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find \nsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of \nmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-\nmedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the \nliscened physicians).\n\nI hope that this clears things up David.\n\nMarty B.\n"}

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,\nbiochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic\npersistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.\n\nMost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of\na viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be\ndetermined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It\nconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting\nplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast\nto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, \nbridging necrosis, or fibrosis. \n\nCPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and\nCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed\nout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have\nit. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing\nareas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe\nit is a continuum.

An automated version of Clinical Proton\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\nfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\n   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's\ndisease.\n   \"We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\nwith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\nAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,\" said Bruce\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\nand a co-author of the study.\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\nand will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\n\n   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:\n\n   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?\n   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\n   How many people does it affect?\n   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\nemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\nof Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree\" and\nsuggests the following criteria:\n\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\n      normal.\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\n\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms\nof dementia.\n -30-\n--\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\n416-629-7000/629-7044\n"}

Bursts are\nusually more complex than this example I will use here.\n        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration\nof 8.95 seconds.

Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.\n        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several\ndifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the\ngalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a\nR=8800Mpc.  \n        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the\nold standby formula:\n                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak\n        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty\nenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.\nAnd lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call\nmoderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that\nmuch energy in one second? \n                                                -jeremy\n\n\n\n"}

WHere are they.\nOriginator: news@nimaster\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.edu\nOrganization: Princeton University\nLines: 51\n\n\nI feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\nBATSE press releases.\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \n     \"if you smack two neutron\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\n      be wrong.\"\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\nburst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \nso-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\nin the failed supernova scenario.\n\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\nit *must* be so-and-so.\n\nRalph Wijers\n\n"}

Some of the information in the posting requires some\nclarification, and I would like to answer some of the questions\nraised on sci.crypt.\n     SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our\ntwo main products at this time are a PC based secure\ncommunications program called SECOM and a general purpose\nencryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.\n     SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link\nbetween two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines.  It\nsupports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard\nto screen \"chat\".  It has its own proprietary communications\nprotocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  All\nthough it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be\ncontinuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.\n     When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented to\nuse DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek export\napproval for the product because it was perceived that the\noverseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing\nopportunity.\n     We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general\nexport approval for anything using DES.  All though the reason\nfor this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something\nto do with secret government to government agreements which are\nstill in effect.\n     In any event, the decision was made to develop a new and\ndifferent algorithm which would take the place of DES.  This was\nthe reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born.\n     At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret.  The\npreliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to\nmake it public once the patent process is complete.  All though\none can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing\nsecret, I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is\nnecessary to let people \"shoot at it\" over an extended period of\ntime to prove its worth.\n     In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it was\nnecessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of\nthe program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had a\nfinished product to submit.\n     Let me state unequivocally that there is NO \"back door\" to\nthe program or the algorithm.  Secured Communications\nTechnologies is a closely held private company and\nNSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way\nwhatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.\n     From a practical business standpoint, we are interested in\nselling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a\nback door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our\ncredibility and our business.\n     With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set\nout to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption\nproducts and systems.  We were able to identify several common\nthreads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design of\na chip with the encryption algorithm \"cast in silicon\" and\ncertain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill\nthe broad range of requirements that we identified.\n     We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips.  In a\npress release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated:\n\n          \"It seems as if the government has an unlimited source\n     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American\n     Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security\n     Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic\n     spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip\n     intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying\n     activities.\"\n\n     If they had asked me to put a \"back door\" in NEA I would\nhave told them to g__ f____ed.\n     Can NSA break NEA?  Or for that matter can they break DES,\nRSA, IDEA, Diffy-Hellman, PGP, RC2, RC4, or whatever?  I don't\nknow and probably never will.\n"}

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not \nall calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-\noxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.

Doubtless it will fail to meet some of\nthe promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's\nthe *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,\nto develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  \n\nThere is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling\naway, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any\nzeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for\nthis must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual\nbillions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will\nno doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:\n\nDC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping\ndevelopment costs low and flying incremental \"X-plane\" hardware.\nIt's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a\ncomplex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would\nhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s\nAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or\nbuilding the DC-Y.\n\nI'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any\nexpansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\nthe DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\nprospect too depressing to bear.\n\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\ndirection.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for\nsmall payloads.)\n\nI read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are\nplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some\nof them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's\nworld that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an\nassembly line.\n\n>You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following:\n[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]\n>3  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable\n>DC-X successor\n\nStrawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. \nThe DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which\nincludes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle\noperations, as well as the \"bird in the hand\" argument your common\nsense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the\nShuttle, not instead of it.\n\nAlso, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful\nfor a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.\n\n>4  Most importantly, that the DC-X will open up LEO to more scientific and\n>technical payloads.\n\nIf a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,\nrather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford\nmore payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites\ninstead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little\noutfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of\nbegging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.

A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater\ncan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are\npotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall\ncorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses\ninvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which\nis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with\nsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic\nglutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts\nattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic\nnecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the\ndelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver\ndamage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.\n\nAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams\nof acetaminophen.

Somehow I've managed to \ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \nit back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \nday for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \nthem).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \nMorgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \npoint out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical \ncommunity.\n\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've \nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\nNow I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\n\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\n(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in \nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\n\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene \nis the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \nwere born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that \nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was \nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \n1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \nthe reserves).\n\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \nliver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \nof warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\n\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \nwill always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \nPMS studies).\n\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \nfill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\n\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role \nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \nit's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.\n\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \nhelping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and \nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \nthemselves more harm than good.\n\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the \"first \nline\" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\n\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \nhas on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \nmedical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\n\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \n20ug/dl.\n\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \nserum retinol levels.\n\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\nfrom their book:\n\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \n\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \nlab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\n\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\nI don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \nthe human fetus.\n\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup \njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.\n\nMarty B.\n\n"}

This could be encrypted after\nthe message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with\na message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting\nblock.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*\nsure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be\nstronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's\nunbreakable.\n \n   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's\nto include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,\neither.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your\npad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your\nopponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext\nin a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going\non.\n \n   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide\nwhether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use\nof 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about\nhalf.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a\nguess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying\nto see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the\nspoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-\nsynched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.\n \n   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure\nas a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.\n \n   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together\nto get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy\nhas no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.\nAny change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess\nof what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?\n \n   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random\nbits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages\njust as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.\nIn fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed\nmessage with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about\nthat.\n \n   Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the\none-time pad?\n \n   --John Kelsey\n"}

It was a bit shorter\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\nbare-bones.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\nin.\n\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\n\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\nthe difference.\n\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \n\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\n\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\npart first.\n\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\n\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\nthis point.\n\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\nto persue work on their own.\n\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.

To get an image on the screen, you had to wait\nuntil the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line\ninto the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many\nduplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line.

That's all.\n\nThe RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page\n1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is\nboth shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a\nmachine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it\nalso wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the\nhigh byte of the address is hardwired to 1).\n\nThe IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers\n(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the\n6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I\nthink this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so\nmany games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do\nsomething else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.\n\nThere was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at\nleast 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I\nimagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly\nto chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so\nthe 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly\nnormal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more\nusual active low chip select.\n\nJohn West\n"}

A friend of mine worked for an\nelectronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold\nequipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with\ndiscount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the\nproducts.\n\nThis company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field \noffices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer\nsystems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out\ndouble-block-encrypted with DES. \n\nTwo days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of\nthe company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to\n\"knock it off\". The president gave in, since his company did a considerable\nbusiness with the federal government.\n\nNow, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they\neven know that the encryption system was installed? Further, since encryp-\ntion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of the\ngovernment's cease-and-desist demand?\n\nThe spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings\nof the law. I'll say \"no thanks\" to Clipper, or anything else the government\nproduces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate. And when\nthe line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy. \n\n    David Hayes    merlin@lerami.lerctr.org\n\n\n\n"}

It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \nFamilies USA.\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \nthat doctors make too much money.\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \nOK.\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \nand are still simmering.\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \nof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \ndo are stealing it from them.\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  \nKarl Marx lives.\n     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such \nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \nbecome a physician?\n     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should \nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \na doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a \ndoctor?\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \ncalled together to remake America's health care.\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \nto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \nmajor cause of high medical costs.\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \na McDonald's?\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \ncabbages.\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \nthey might have been more honest if they had said:\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\n     \"You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\n     \"In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at \nyour blubbery bods all day.\n     \"So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.\"\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \nthere is another solution: Don't use them.\n     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those \nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \nupon your head and declare you fit.\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\n     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \nhow to give it its shots.\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \npollsters should earn?\n\n\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \nServices.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n--\n**********************************************\nVinay J.

Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of\nsupporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too\nlong-term.  \n\n(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because\nof socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to\ncompete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't\nhas taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)\n\nAs a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve\nitself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should\ndrive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But\nthe whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or\nsome countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So\nthe U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a\nlot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,\ndoesn't it?)\n\nBut this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to\ncost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new\ntechnology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,\ndespite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly\nearnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in\nnew technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little\nsense to try to save money.\n\nOf course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY\ndisagrees about that the wisdom should be.  \n\nIt's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control\navailable in industry today were derived from Government projects.\nGANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes\nfrom DoD projects and their contractors.

Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. \nComing back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in \nits orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the \nplane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will \nrequire more fuel to adjust.

Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has\ninformed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,\nwhich is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field\nfrom distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.\nSorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to\ntake another ISM class :-(\n\n  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave\na talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief\noverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of\nabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then\ngave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is \nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\nNeptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\n\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\nideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence\nfor the impact theory.\n\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's \norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\nto be very hard to see.\n\n  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see\na howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.\n\n  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\nmarketplace.\n\n  I'm just telling you what he said.\n\n                          Michael\n\n-- \n-----                                                    Michael Richmond\n\"This is the heart that broke my finger.\"    richmond@astro.princeton.edu\n\n"}

And of course, everybody would buy them.\n\n\nThe whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that\nyou can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to follow\ntheir rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and\nnail.\n\nQuite simply, with Clipper established, it would be much harder for\nanother encryption maker to define a new standard, to make phones that\ncan't talk to the leading phone companies.   The result is tappable\ncryptography without laws forbidding other kinds, for 99% of the\npopulace.\n\n\nTo get untappable crypto, you would have to build a special phone that\nruns on top of this system, and everybody you talk to would have to\nhave an indentical one.\n\nThat's the chicken and egg of crypto.  The government is using its\nvery special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new\ntechnologies to control this one in a way they like.\n\n\nIt's almost admirably clever.

The problem is understanding the basic\nchemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them\nefficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from\nplants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have\nto orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use \ntechnology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of \nusing dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies\nbring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in \ndirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in \nhydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is \nstunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So \nnow you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar\ninteractions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's\nwhat needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.\nWe also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.\n\n>So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective\n>methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies\n>which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight. \n\nFirst you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information\nout there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.\nThis could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then\nwe can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.\n\n>Such a detailed\n>literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates\n>and clearly important to existing space programs.\n>In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into\n>various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.\n>This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the\n>basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,\n>and any other source!\n\nUnless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,\nI think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search \nfirst.

Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500\nfeet altitude.\n\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\n\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\nshould know about anyway ;-).\n\n>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\n>> and determine distance.

You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\none place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for\nthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...\n\n>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in\n>a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this\n>concept.\n\nNope.

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital \nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center \nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \nof 1.96. \n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \n\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \ncharges. \n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \nrate. \n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \ndelivery (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\nconfirmed as having malaria. \n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \n128 (82%) responded. \n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \nmalaria. \n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \nevening. \n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \n\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \nshort-term travelers to such areas. \n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \nfalciparum has not been reported. \n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \ninjections. \n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \n\n                               ActHIB Trademark \n\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \n\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \nprogram committee provided guidance. \n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \nwomen's issues. \n\n                                Recommendations\n\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \n\n                                 Epidemiology\n\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \nchildren and adolescents. \n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \nare appearing all the time. \n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \nand prognosis. \n\n                            Social/political Issues\n\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \nfocused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for \nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \n\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\n\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \n\n                               Pediatric Issues\n\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\ninfected children has tripled.

If an adversary knows the \nplaintext of a message, he can change it into any other message.  \nHere's how it works.\n\nAlice is sending Bob a plaintext P, under a key stream S\nAlice computes the ciphertext C = S xor P,  and sends it to Bob.\n\nEve knows the plainext P, but wants the message to appear as P'.\nEve intercepts C, and computes  C' = C xor P xor P' = S xor P'.\nEve sends C' to Bob.\n\nBob decrypts C' by computing  C'xor S = P',  thus receiving the \nfalse message which was substituted by Eve.\n\n\nNow the question is how can this attack be defeated with information\ntheoretic security, not just computational security.\nCan we define something like \"ideal authentication\" which is the\nanalog of ideal security.  Can we obtain ideal authentication ?\n\nIf not, how much can we limit Eve's control over the message ?\n\nIf we can achieve ideal authentication, does the solution use more\nkey bits or expand the message ?

See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).\n\nYou can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the\nClassic Example, but there are probably others.\n\nIridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By\nlooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises\nyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.\n\nThe two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:\n\n1: How does it work?\n\n2: What evidence is there?\n\nThe answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to\nevaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on\nreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the\norgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are\nsupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or\nenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.\n(Always beware the words \"channel\" and \"energy\" in any spiel put out\nby an alternative practitioner.)\n\nThe answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is\nanecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in\nmainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of\nrich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done\nand papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.\n\nThe word \"licensed\" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by\nwhom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and\nrequires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong\nplants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove\nand Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license\nextends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be\ntold that it means \"(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist\".\n\nBTW, the usual term is \"herbalist\".

A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\npayload on an expendable second stage.\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\n  \n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\nstudies trying straighten out the government's future space\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\nfor future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\n   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't\nthat there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\nthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a\nfinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor\n  \n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n"}

Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus \nexpression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this  \nrecombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus \ndoes in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in \npatients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune \nresponses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and \nCD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.

In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-\nantibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific \nactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  \nmay contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 \nbinding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added \nsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, \nstimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune \nfunction.

The \nanti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of \nleukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  \nactivity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to \nbarely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to \ntwelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  \nBreastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory \nillnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive \nmothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-\n1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than \nbottlefed infants (9.7 months).

Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the \nmedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug \nabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  \nThere were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  \nwere deceased.

People who contract TB usually \ndevelop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria \nagain.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight \noff a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  \nhypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to \nAIDS, \"a hindrance to public health initiatives.\"   However, their hypothesis \nthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  \nThe U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, \nno prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this \nhypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to \nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.

Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  \nThe researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with \nhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  \nprofound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the \nobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had \ncirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the \nend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, \ncontained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  \naminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, \nhomologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  \nThese autoantibodies, which also  recognize \"native\" class II molecules and \nmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells \"in vivo\", were at low tires \n(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  \nautoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and \nHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss \nin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful \n\"autoimmune\" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA \nantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell \ncounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  \nrapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with \nthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 23, 1993 \n       ================================================================    \n\"TB Makes a Comeback\" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   \n(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) \n\n     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United \nStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, \nminorities, and prisoners.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because \nthose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with \ntreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public \nhealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic \"because the number of \ncases  is increasing faster than we can treat people,\" said Dr. George  \nDiferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to \nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \nresidents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  \nmedication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more \nexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to \ntreat.\n ================================================================    \n \"Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern \nFlorida: Artifact or Reality?\" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. \n83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) \n\n     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in \nsouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write \nOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  \nThe researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal \nPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual \ntransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, \nor  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route \nof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records \nfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually \ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor \nwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  \nstandardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were \nreviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission \ncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the \npercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties \nbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to \nheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men \nand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  \nheterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after \nadjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the \nnational average, the researchers  conclude.\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                                AIDS Statistics\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                            World Health Organization, Geneva\n                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve\n\n                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD\n                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE\n\n15 January 1993 -

However,\nusing the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right\nplace and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court. \n\nQuestion : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of\nview, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen\nto communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police\nalso, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the\nnon-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).\nThe privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY\nhave something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things.\nIf an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data\ncarried by a person rather than sending it electronically. \nThe clipper chip will not change this. \n\nThe problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper\nchip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own\npolice following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have\nits own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international\ntraffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there\nbe an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?\n\nForbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot\na crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate\non the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will\nbe more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase\nin the next years.\n\nI think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the\nrisk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's\ncommunications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?\nI think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done\nnot only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can\nhelp reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real\ndanger and it can be helpful.\n\nPh. HOOGVORST\n"}

Seems to me that encryption ought to\nbe covered by the first amendment.   Using this line of reasoning, the\ngovernment shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and\nwhat encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting\none's freedom of speech.  In other words, encrypted data---text,\ngraphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech.\nFor this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use\nof encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time the\ngovernment should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her\nencryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data\nin question may be something that isn't protected by the first\namendment such as kiddy porn.  Even in a case like this the\ngovernment should be required to get a search warrant before coercing\nsomeone into revealing the keys.\n\nBTW, what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art\nnowdays.

The\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\n\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\n\n\u00a5 Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\n\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\n\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\n\n\u00a5 Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\nManagement System.\n\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\n\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\n\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\n\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\npropulsion systems.\n\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\n\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\noperations costs, he said.\n\n\u00a5 Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\n\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\nattitude.\n\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\n\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\n\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\n\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\nmanagement options have been developed including:\n\n\u00a5 Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\ncommand.\n\n\u00a5 Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\nAdministrator.\n\n\u00a5 Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\nhand-picked program office.\n\n\u00a5 Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\nelement of the current program.\n\n\u00a5 Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\n\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\n\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\nand ground operations.\n\nWhat's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\nbe held May 3.\n\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\n\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\ncarried on the schedule are:\n\nApril 26\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\n\nApril 27\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\n\nMay 3\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nMay 15\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nJune 7\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\n\n\n(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)\n \n"}

Is there any data on\nhome care vs. day care?\n\n-- Does being sick \"build immunity\" (leading to less illness later),\ndoes it make kids \"weaker\" (leading to more illness later), or does it\nnot have any long term effect?\n\n-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\nterm effects?\n\n-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\nnormal, and what does one do about it?\n\n-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\n\nAny data, information or advice relating to this would be much\nappreciated.

Now, in the days when people had lived in\nmud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood\ntechnology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in\nRuritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until\nthis point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on\nsomeone's home, but the new technology made this tempting. This being\na civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars\nand watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,\nwould get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going\non. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but\neveryone pretended that this didn't happen.\n\nOne day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,\nsuddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Things\nwould go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely\nprivate.\n\nIndignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have\nvideo cameras installed in every nook and cranny. \"After all\", they\nsaid, \"with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing\nvideo cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --\nthey are just keeping the old one.\"\n\nA wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the\nlives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the\nmud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that\nRuritania was a civilized country where not everything that was\nexpedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it\nhad been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to\nsolve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its\nexpedience. Indeed, \"why have warrants at all\", he asked, \"if we are\ninterested only in expedience?\"\n\nA famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She\nnoted that people might take photographs of children masturbating\nshould the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,\nand the law was passed.\n\nSoon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths\nwhile speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading\ntheir lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the\npolice said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their\nlawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never\nbefore been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but Dorothy\nQuisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of\ncovering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and\nmutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused\nof being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one\nwanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked, so a\ncompromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with\nmicrophones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man\nlamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old\nlip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were\ninstalled everwhere.\n\nHowever, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent\ncitizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of\nthem would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not\nunderstand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at\nall times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that\nthey speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. \"After all\",\nDorothy Quisling pointed out, \"they might be using the opportunity to\nspeak in private to mask terrorist activities!\"  Terrorism struck\nterror into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of\nthis new law.\n\nMeanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all\nof this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which\nall Ruritanians were proud. \"Why\", he asked, \"are we obligated to\nsacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police\neasier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in\ncrime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!\"\n\nHowever, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law\nrequired, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a\nmicrophone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived\nand took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture\nwas, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been\nrecently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene\nthoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the\nmajor problems of the new age of plenty and joy.\n\n--\nPerry Metzger\t\tpmetzger@shearson.com\n--\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\n\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\ndiscoveries.\n\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\n\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\nSun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\n\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\n\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\nachievements of the 20th century.\n     \n\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\n\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\n\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\n\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\nbackup and supplemental power.\n\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\ncontrol spacecraft.\n\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\nspacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body\nand the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\n\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\n\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\n\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\nbodies.\n\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\n\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\n\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\n\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\n\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet's dense cloud cover\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\nradioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their\ndescent toward the surface.\n\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\nneighborhood and our own planet.\n     \n\nThe Sun\n\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\nmaterial left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\n\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\nis 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\n\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\nyears to cool off completely.\n\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\n\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\nnever have developed on Earth.\n     \n\nMercury\n\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\nsolar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\n\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\nvisible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\n\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\nmiles).\n\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\ndensity of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\nand helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\nFahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\n\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\nSun! \n\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\nmake Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core\nor those of any of the planets.\n\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\nplanet's surface.\n     \n\nVenus\n\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\nrest.\n\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's\ninstruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\n\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\n\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\ntransmit data for another hour.\n\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\nexample, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\nplanets.\n\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as\ndense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\nEarth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\nspace. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\nlead.\n\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\nfirst means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\nNASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\nof the surface.\n\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\n\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\n\n     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\nalternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\n     \n\nEarth\n\n     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\n\n     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\nthe early days of the solar system.\n\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\n\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\nplanet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\nejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\n\n     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet's\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\n\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather\nsystems.\n\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\nEarth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\nplanet in dangerous ways.\n     \n\nThe Moon\n\n     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\n\n     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\n\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\n\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\n\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\n\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\ncaptured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\n     \n\nMars\n\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\nsystem's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\n\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\n\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\n\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\n\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\n\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\ndunes.\n\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\nthere.\n\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\n\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\n\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\nfog can form in valleys.\n\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\n\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\n\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\n\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\nEarth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \n     \n\nAsteroids\n\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\norbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\nWinslow, Arizona.\n\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\ndiameter of our Moon. \n\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\n\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes\nEarth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\n\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\nlike terrestrial rocks.\n\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\nseparated by very large distances.\n\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\nmaterials.\n     \n\nJupiter\n\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\nwas the first port of call.\n\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\nduring flybys in 1979.\n\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\ncharacterize Jupiter's atmosphere.\n\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\nplanet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\nbelow. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\n\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\nmillion years old.\n\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\n\n     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\nminiature solar system.\n\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\nJupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\nto Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\n     \n\nGalilean Satellites\n\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\nplanet-sized satellites.\n\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.\n\n     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\nGalilean moons.\n\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\ncold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its\ncenter.\n\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\nthe moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the\nsurface.\n\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\n\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\n     \n\nSaturn\n\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\nmiles) per hour.\n\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\nAugust 1981.\n\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\norbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\n\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\n\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\nthat make up the major rings.\n\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near\nSaturn's poles.\n\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps\nin the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \n\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\nVenus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\nUnfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's\ndense clouds.\n\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\nconverting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\n\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\nTitan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\n     \n\nUranus\n\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\nground observations since the planet's discovery over two\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\n\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\nsolar system.\n\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\n\n     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\nvapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\nplanet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\n\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\n\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\n\n     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\nits interior exposed on its surface.\n\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\n11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright\nparticles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,\nboulder-sized chunks.\n     \n\nNeptune\n\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's\natmosphere was more active than Uranus'. \n\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\nsize of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\nhour.\n\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\nother gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like\nUranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\n\n     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\nsimilar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\n\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\nwere not spotted.\n\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's\nglare for observers on Earth.\n\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\naccompany the planet's modest current rings.\n\n     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of\nwater-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\ncap. \n\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\nthick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\n     \n\nPluto\n\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\nNeptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\nremain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\n\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\ncelestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \n\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\n1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's\nand Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \n\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\n     \n\nComets\n\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\n\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\n\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\nrise to the comet's \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\nleft behind in a curved arc.\n\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\ndramatic light shows.\n\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\nto the inner solar system.\n\n     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\nbecause he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\nsee it.\n\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\nappearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\n\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\nhigh speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\nHalley's Comet in 1986.\n     \n\nConclusion\n\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\nneighbors in space. \n\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\nand beautiful places and objects.\n\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\n\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\ninvestigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\nprocesses on Earth.\n\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\nbelt.\n\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\nlunar base or a martian colony!\n\n- end -\n     \n"}

L. \nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \nbulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are \nmuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told \nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't \ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do \nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \npH to basically starve the candida out.\n\n\nMarty B.\n"}

(if this is the case; don't call your-\n\t  self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.)   This\n\t  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers.  Don't\n\t  turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the\n\t  technical sides of the issue.\n\n\t- Don't overdo jargon and gobbledygook.  Remember, your letter\n\t  will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may\n\t  even be a college student; if they don't understand it, your\n\t  views won't even make the 'running total' sheets.\n\n\t- Be concise; don't ramble.  Rants are *definitely* out of place.\n\t  Cite references, if necessary, but only use \"accepted\" references\n\t  like academic journals.  \"My neighbor Jim\" is *not* a real refer-\n\t  ence.  8)\n\n\t- Unfortunately, very few Congresscritters *really* understand\n\t  electronic communications.  Encourage them to pick up access\n\t  to Compuserve, America Online, or one of the Free-Nets.  Offer\n\t  to send them samples.  If you are in a position to do so, offer\n\t  them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your\n\t  systems.  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in\n\t  town.  Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them\n\t  *will* give your opinions more credence.\n\n\t- In addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail\n\t  to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing\n\t  with the issue.  If your Congresscritter isn't on the committee,\n\t  they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.\n\n--Wes\n\nps> I'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the\n    more traditional media, but Usenet doesn't have a decent track record\n    in the analogy department.  8)\n\n-- \nRachel Elizabeth Morgan  --  4/13/93, 7:00 am    | Oh yeah, I can be reached as\n9 pounds 4 ounces (despite coming 3 weeks early) |     morgan@engr.uky.edu\n                                                 |-----------------------------\nTo netters who gave constant encouragement and prayer - thanks for everything!\n"}

If it\nchanges anything. \n\nYou can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you\nhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave\ncooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's\nhard to digest anyway. \n\nFor comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal \"last\" longer eat pasta or\nrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe\nsmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the\nbaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How\ntight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses \nyour middle. Be sure not to \"suck in\" your stomach when sitting, again it\nwill put pressure on the digestive tract. \n\nTry laying on your sides, back,\nand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.\nEasier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby\n\"turn\" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.\nWhen you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the\ndiaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my\nsecond one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he\ndidn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.\n\n\nMaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe\nshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. \nBut this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something\nto be avoided if possible. \n\nNausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy.

You are correct, it is illegal to send cryptographic\ncode (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license.\nHOWEVER, every US citizen has a general export license, allowing\nexport of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech.\nThis has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some\nthings which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without\nfirst obtaining a license.\n\n   > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only\n   > way to find out is to apply for a license.\n\n   Nope, talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.  But, in\ngeneral, the government has to have a very good national security case\nto try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to\npublish.  (Yes, I worded that the way I did intentionally.  It is a\nlot easier for the government to TRY to prevent the export of\ninformation than to charge someone with a crime after the fact.\nEspionage is probably the only exception.)\n\n   > Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send\n   > to Canada if YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send\n   > if you don't.\n\n    If you are a US citizen, you have a general license.  (I am not a\nlawyer, so take some of this with a grain of salt.  However, I have\nalso had to swim through both ITAR and export regs in a few cases.)\n\n--\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRobert I.

In order for U.S.  industries to\n>compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't\n>has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)\n\nThis definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into\nthe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\nas salary.\n\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\n\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\n\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\nget supported, and how much.  \n\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\nwhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \n\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\n-- \nHerman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399\nPhone: (317)494-6054\nhrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  \n{purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)\n"}

I don't think so. If you take the view that the\ntail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed.

First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \nit's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\nfor a putative technological alien.\n\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\nit's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\nwouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\nlarge creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\n\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly\nlost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\nthat must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\nThe dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production \nbecause it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \nI'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\nthe size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\nwould be capable of that much activity.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n"}

I was busy keeping my experiment\ngoing and keeping track of all the parts during the \"return\" of\ngravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay\nattention to physiology at that time.\n\nAfter about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one\nof the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion\nsickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly\n-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,\nconcious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to\nparabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I\nhad to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically\nuseless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in\nthe back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just\nthis purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.\n(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous\npeople who don't get sick on the thing.)\n\nI didn't think of it as a \"constant sensation of falling\" so\nmuch as like swimming in air.

It\nworks, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let any\nwater in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get\nout by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.

For instance, in the system outlined in the May 1993\nissue of \"Byte\", the process of getting one's public key listed for general\nuse involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies, which\ndo calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers of\nthe public key directory, which combines these results into your listed\npublic key.

It's much\nstronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of\n160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first\nstandardized, a simple double encryption would not have the same\nstrength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less\nthe beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of\nvery high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit\nthat description.\n\nWhy n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  I\nhave no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they're\nconstructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.\nA goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change\n-- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit\npatterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness.  So the n_i\nvalues are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming\ndistance.\n\nIn any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i\nfrom the U_i, let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U, they don't\nneed to find S_i.  But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2.  In\ntheory, they should never even see those values, even with a warrant.)\n\nThe real question, I think, is why use this scheme at all, as opposed\nto a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is\n*much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, the\nEFF, and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number\ngenerator, and that it passed every test you could think of.  When you\ncome back next week to program some more chips, does it still work that\nwell?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components been\nchanged out from under you?  Does it still work well the in the\npresence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards\nselecting 1 bits?  Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on it\nagain, but that's hard.\n\nConsider, on the other hand, a software solution.  You bring your own\nfloppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc.  It's a\nlot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words.\n(Yes, I can think of ways to cheat software, too.  I think that they're\na lot harder.)\n\nThere are three issues with Clipper.  The first is whether or not the\narchitecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer,\nwith one significant exception, is yes.  I really do think that NSA and\nNIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming that\ntheir real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, under\ncertain carefully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk of\nabuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on a\nprogramming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2 should be\nloaded onto the chip separately.)  To those who disagree (and I don't\nclaim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoning\nsufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions\nsection of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the\nscheme), I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with\nimplementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights and\ndue process.  What would you do differently?  In answering this\nquestion, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both\nstrong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap\n*some* domestic users, is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary to\nchallenge those assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue I\npresent below.  Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technical\naspects.  And no, I don't by any means claim that just because\nsomething can be done, it should be.)\n\nThe second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually\ngoing to be used.  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't\nmean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA will\nsubstitute its own chips between the programming facility and the\nshipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so that\nthe escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry,\nguys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have\nbought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have no\nanswer to this question, and at the moment, I don't see a way of\nanswering it.  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer\nto the final question, below.\n\nThe third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good\nidea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.\nI think that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civil\nlibertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at great\nlength on the net in the Elder Days, and that I don't have the energy\nto repeat now.  But that means that I'm willing to accept that some\nlaws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights of\nindividuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in our\nsystem -- the right to issue search warrants, and while that power has\ncertainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly in\nother cases.  Is key escrow sufficiently different?  I think so -- but\nagain, it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertarians\nto answer, of course, since Clipper is completely alien to much of the\nrest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for those\nwho give their unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much more\ndistant from.)\n\n\n\t\t--Steve Bellovin\n"}

Too much can block the\nexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some \nhearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your\nown, or at your physician's office.

You can buy\na syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever\nyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.

Some studies suggest \nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\n\n> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?\n> How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

But many viruses \nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\n\n> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\n> term effects?\n\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\n \n> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\n> normal, and what does one do about it?\n\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \nassociated with the infection.\n\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\n\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's \nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.

Big difference.\n   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution\n   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well\n   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)\n   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...\n\nMerging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right\nenergy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation\nwith galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting\nall the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of\nbaryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a\nplasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating\nenough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it\nhappens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to\nmake tight-binaries of neutron stars.\n\nAnother cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a\nneutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but\nthat uses pretty far-out physics.\n\nMy point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so\nGRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't\nrule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which\nconverts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black\nholes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets\naren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which\nmodifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these\nmechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the \"Tunguska Meteorite\"\nwas a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely\nto be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet\ncollisions matches the GRB rate well.\n\nThe fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort\ncloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them\nout.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the\nright distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible\nto match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the\nwrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-\ncloud GRB's at all.\n\nExecutive summary: we don't know enough to rule out out the Oort\ncloud.\n"}

Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,\nrelaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as\nthose with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.\n\nAntihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom)\nare potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine\n(Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work\nwell in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long\nhalf-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual\nhangover or \"drugged\" feeling the next morning.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n"}

Larson, 1984, North \n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \n          hardcover. \n          \n\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \n          \n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \n          edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.  \n          Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is \n          \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988). \n          \n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \n          validity. \n          \n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \n          they contain. \n          \n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical \n          portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \n          space and time: \n          \n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \n          \n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \n          \n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \n          ready for those also. \n          \n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \n          used to maintain them. \n          \n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \n          SINGLE stars. \n          \n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \n          \n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \n          observations that contradict their theories would find \n          Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an \n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \n          coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray \n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \n          at random. \n          \n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson's book contains \n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \n\n          \n                                   Robert E.

Brown\nSecretary\nDepartment of Commerce\n14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW\nWashington, DC 20236\n\nDear Secretary Brown:\n\n   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy \nand security of telecommunications transmissions and data in \na networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the \nAdministration's endorsement of an electronic encryption \nstandard, based upon \"clipper chip\" technology, have raised a \nnumber of related issues.  The international competitiveness \nof U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is \na key factor that the government should consider when \naddressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the \nnation moves forward in developing the national \ncommunications and information infrastructure, security of \ntelecommunications transmissions and network data will be an \nincreasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of \nusers.\n\n   The \"hacker\" community can compromise the integrity of \ntelecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the \nnetwork.  The people and businesses that use the nation's \ntelecommunications network and the personal computers linked \nthrough it increasingly are demanding that information be \nprotected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.\n\n   I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean \nthat to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies \nwould be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. \ngovernment customers, and another for private, commercial \nusers who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may \ninadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping \nto serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis \nof this issue, please respond to the following questions:\n\n1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the \nAdministration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST \nor the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the \nnature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any \nplans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how \nsuch experts will be chosen.\n\n2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the \nholders of the \"keys\" to decrypt scrambled data?  What \nprocedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to \ndesignate such key holders?\n\n3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the \nAdministration contain a \"trap door\" or \"back door,\" which \ncould allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to \ncrack the code?\n\n4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used \nfor communications will require new techniques and additional \nequipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid \nadvancement of telecommunications technology?\n\n5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place \non the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to \nconsumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard \nin their equipment?\n\n6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the \ncompetitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the \n\"clipper chip\" technology on U.S. exports of computer and \ntelecommunications hardware and software products?\n\n   I would appreciate your response by no later than close-\nof-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any \nquestions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or \nKaren Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward J. Markey\nChairman\n\n###\n-- \nGlenn Tenney\nvoice: (415) 574-3420      fax: (415) 574-0546\ntenney@netcom.com          Ham radio: AA6ER\n"}

When I asked, people said that the\n>interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\n>complicated.\n\nYou are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not\ninterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal\nyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an\nall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's\nheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks\nthat weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the\nproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at\nthat point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not\nunreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things\nin realtime if you write efficient code.\n\nIn case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)\nfilter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out\nthere know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with\nresistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as\nthe most cost effective method for volume production runs.\n\n\n>Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\n>sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\n>antialiasing filters.

So, assuming the quality of\n>all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\n>allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\n>filtering.\n\nActually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that\nthey have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to\nfilter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and\ngive the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they\ncharge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.\n\nI seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are\nbuilt to a price spec, and that spec says \"cheap as possible!\". \n\n\n>\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad\n\n  -dave\n-- \nDave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com\n                                        37N 17.382    121W 59.190 \n"}

A few years ago, I did some calculations on a\n\"Grand Tour\" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt \nthat\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a\nprobe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\nJupiter and beyond. The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\nrelatively great distance.\n---\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers,\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\nthat planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\nsystems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\ntrajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \nwell-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer\nplanets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of\ncourse. \n\nMARCU$\n   \n> ==\n> Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked\n> \n"}

Anesthetic\nagents\n>can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out\nof\n>the body as easily.\n\nThe original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital\nbut I can answer a few general points.\n\nElderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after\nbeing in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\n\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\npatients early.\n\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\n\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing\nmore it is hard to comment.\n\nDon Mackie - his opinions\nesiology will disavow...\n"}

None of his A-1 through A-5\nantineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against\nexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against\nleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce\ntoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth\nof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)\n\nBurzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1\nand A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been\nextracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually\ndistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10\nagainst a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines\nfrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and\nsmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous\nsystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited\nneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.\n\nIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's\ntheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to\nPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying\npeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for\nantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1\nmixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a\nchemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically\nextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are\nhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects\nof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10\ndoes not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce\nteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMany of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early\nresearch, past and present support by others for his work have been\nshown to be untrue.\n\n\nsdb\n---\nsdb@ssr.com\n\n"}

You are surely\nnot going to say \"the people are not to know, until it is too late...\"\nThis IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE, isn't\nit?  That is, the people ARE the government's BOSSES?  The BOSSES\nwant to know what the *@()#*&(@ is going on here...\n\nYou see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I have\nseen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least\nappear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom\nfrom Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves against\nviolent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', they\narrive only in time to clean up the mess: I would be DEAD if I had to\ndepend on 911...).   You see, with all that talk about National smart\nID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial of\nmeans to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now),\nit looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace\nEVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it would take\nis requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions...\nand with no effective data protection, and with the people suitably\ndisarmed, there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it, now\nwould there?

(or is that no longer regarded as necessary,\nseeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, the\nAdministration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, then\nspringing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE\nto me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were\nNOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a little\nbit curious, don't you?  I sure would like to know who to not vote\nfor come election time...\n\nYes, I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this, because I recall it\nwas you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could\nhave been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago...  I\nalso recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-be\nreally didn't care (or were not told, or both).\n\nFrom what I see, Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't\nwant the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I don't\nthink I would want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext.\nCertainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious\ntrade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security.\nGiven enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crooked\njudge, and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou, they wouldn't be\nhard to find.  So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and the\nGovernment with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop.  You know\nthe first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing for\nTHEIR communications.  I bet the government won't, either (except perhaps\nto order a pizza).\n\nTell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity,\nsomeone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desire\nto have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an\nunconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door\nraid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools',\nusing civil forfeiture, so there will be no inconvenient need to\nPROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen?\n\nI have yet another question, are we going to see articles in all the\npublic magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how great\nthis is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion\nof privacy?  That the government is going to be so kind as to let\nus 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT?  What you want to bet that I am\ncorrect here?\n\nPlease answer these questions.  As citizens of the United States, we\nhava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have\nout of the goodness of their hearts...\n\nFunny thing, though - with all these proposals, I don't feel ONE BIT\nsafer from drug dealers, terrorists, or a common street thug.  I am\nbeginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities,\nor our own government gone out of control?\n\nRe-assure us, please.

Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority\ndrive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.\n\nDo I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning.\nI could go on with these examples for a long time....\n\nLook at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks,\nand others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized, \nimprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be\nfree from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was \ngood for them.\n\nI think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority,\nis immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in\nhis/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all\ncommon sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay\nmy Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government\ntaking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.\nThis is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people \nby logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have\nequal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and\nmedical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of\nbeauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered\nnight sky a right.\n\nHave you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people?\nThe sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail\nthan you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.\n\nNow imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution\nyou have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole\nlife, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see\nsqualor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live\nfor?  \n\nI admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both.\nI, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.\nThat is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.\n\nGeorge\n-- \n|  George Krumins                     /^\\        The Serpent and the Rainbow  | \n|  gfk39017@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu       <^^. .^^>                                  |\n|  Pufferfish Observatory          <_ (o) _>                                  |\n|                                     \\_/                                     | \n"}

I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an\noncologist.\n\nA bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a\ndose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the\ndistribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given\nintravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will\ninsert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. \n\nAfter a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the\nbody, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high \nconcentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for\nareas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.\n\nAs far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required\nto start the IV line.\n\nWhat the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may\nhave resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother\nhas had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the\nskeletal system.\n\nI hope I have answered some of your questions.

When the mission\nwas planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was\nenormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.

Obviously that is coming from somewhere.\nMy guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   \n\nI just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper\nbetter,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable\nspace manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost.\nit has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.\n\npat\n\n"}

The\nspace environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to\ntemperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation\neffects on materials), so your \"fabric\" may not retain any flexibility\nfor long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure\nchanges in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could\nlead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.\n\nThese are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal\nfor an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of\nsuccess.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     \"Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll\n      work hard enough to bring them about.\" -- Ashleigh Brilliant\n"}

But for smaller scale things it might work.\nCould some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that\nare issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week\n(for instance).  If further surveilance was needed, they would have\nto go back to the escrow service to get another key.  This would\nmake it useless for local police to database keys they have used.\n\nI assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need\nto be able to decypher the message.  But any thoughts on the subject?\n\nThanks,\nTauren Mills\n\nTauren Mills\ntauren@rigel.cs.pdx.edu\n"}

It is more than 99 percent \neffective.\n\n\"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \npregnancy,\" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. \"As an injectable, \ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \nmissing a daily dose.\"\n\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \ninjections.\n\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \nbefore making a decision to use it.\n\nDepo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\n\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\n\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \nosteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this \npotential effect.\n\nDepo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for \ncontraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., \nwhich will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive \nInjection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. \nAt that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause \nbreast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, \nincluding breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses\n                      P92-37 Food and Drug Administration\n                        Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new \nrules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life-\nthreatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. \n\n\"These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious \nillnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would \notherwise be possible,\" said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. \"The effort \nto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and \nindeed a hallmark of this administration.\" \n\nThese rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to \napprove a drug based on \"surrogate endpoints\" or markers. They apply when the \ndrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such \nendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in \nthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified \nscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. \n\nUse of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval \nearlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or \nprevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. \n\nThe new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and \neffectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. \nThe drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct \npostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate \nendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. \n\nOne new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a \nmodel of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the \ncause of AIDS. \n\nAccelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that \na drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used \nsafely only under a restricted distribution plan. \n\n\"The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process \nwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight,\" said FDA \ncommissioner David A.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \nvisual impairment \n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \nYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of \nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \nsurgically.\" \n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By \nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). \n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and \nSteinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 19\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease\n\n                          Research Resources Reporter\n                           written by Mary Weideman\n                                 Nov/Dec 1992\n                         National Institutes of Health\n\n\n     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary \nheart disease in native populations of developing countries that have \ntraditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to \ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \ncountries. \n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \nlow in cholesterol and fat.\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\ncholesterol. \n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \ninvestigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol \nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's \"affluent\" diet used in the study \nranks a CSI of 149. \n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects' mean plasma \ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \ndays. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \nof their usual high fat intake. \n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \ndisease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different \ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                             General Announcments\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \ncalling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\notherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional\n\"difficult\" patient.\n\nPoint 2:\n\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\na treatment point-of-view.\n\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\n\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\nfrom them.\n\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\n\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.\nJust my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)\n\nComments?\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

I'm still not sure that if a \nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\n\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\nBut some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \noxidative damage in the body).\n\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \ncouldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really \nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \n\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\n\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation \nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \nseparate the fiction from the fact.\n\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing \nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\n\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \npart of the ageing process in humans).\n\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\n\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any \nbetter).\n\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \nI'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm \ngoing to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.\n\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's \ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his \nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \n\nI'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\nHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your \nsinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).\n\nMarty B.\n"}

The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer\nin one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with \npyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite\nzone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes\naway.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional \nto the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.\nThis could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.\n\nDancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their \nbodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.\n\nThe current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the\nAmiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera \ntrained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of\nview, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events\ncan be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been\nfun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy.\nStill, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances,\nyou can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights,\nand I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting and\nvideo brightness and contrast adjustments.  I have yet to do anything\nparticularly useful or artistic, but I have hopes...\n\n"}

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\n\n\"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\nand death in the United States,\" the CDC said.\n\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a \"myriad\" of newly\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\n\n\"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,\"\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\nundermined by drug resistance.\n\n=====*=====\n\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\n\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\ndamage: legal liability.\n\nA federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\nexpenses and lost wages.\n\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\n\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\n\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\ncountry -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\n\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\ndiagnosing the disease.\n\nLawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\nworker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\nlost earnings.\n\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\nnegligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\ndisease.\n\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\nto establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\nagainst Lyme disease.\"\n\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\nThe workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\nsome work sites.\n\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding\nthat it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\npants to protect against bug bites.\n\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\n\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\nsupply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\nget infected.\n\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\npesticide.\n\n=====*=====\n\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\n\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\nevaluation is recommended.\n\n\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS 'N' ANSWERS *****\n\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\neditor.\n\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\n\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\ninfected.\n\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\nback that claim up with documentation.

As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can\nfigure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods.\n(The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that\nsell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell\nthousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones\nare in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the\ncost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.\n\nI don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.\n\n\n-tony\n\n>>usual disclaimer<<\n"}

But if I operate on a person and he lives\nnormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''\n    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,\nthe Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of\nthe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the\nsuffering of the thousands trapped there.\n    ``I lived through hell together with the people of\nSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest\nheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.\n    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant\nat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he\nhad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says\nhe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for\nguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without\nanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean\nsections.\n    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the\nfirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000\npatients.\n    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from\nTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people\ncarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him\nthrough guerrilla terrain, he said.\n    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells\nlanded within one minute in an area half the size of a football\nfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of\nthe dead were women and children.\n    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the\nchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the\nblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.\n    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not\npiece them together. One woman holding her two children in her\nhands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no\nheads.''\n    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were\ndeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had\nthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.\n    The six general practitioners who had been operating before\nhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They\ndidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''\n    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by\nmid-September he had run out of supplies.\n    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes\nthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no\nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain\nbecause it increased bleeding.\n    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and\nstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were\nimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.\n    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.\n    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived\nfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.\n    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in\nmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the\nregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''\n    Then the hunger set in.\n    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began\nair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day\nfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.\n    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the\npeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.\n    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in\nSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.\n    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after\nvisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.\n    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of\npeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when\nI left. And I cried too.''\n\n-- \nSharon Machlis Gartenberg\nFramingham, MA  USA\ne-mail: sharon@world.std.com\n\n"}

Considering \nthe confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO \ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \nof my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these \nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \n\n\n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \n\n\nI'd like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n\n\n(P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, \njust a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know \nthat other people may not accept it without a complaint.)  \n"}

The \nmaterial posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in \noptical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be \nthat other countries do also. \n\n    Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do \nit, and why do they do it?\n\n\nAllen Thomson                     SAIC                        McLean, VA\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOh, yes: I don't speak for SAIC.  \n\n"}

At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous\n    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near\n    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part\n    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They\n    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became\n    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle\n    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby\n    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were\n    visible till morning sunrise.\n\n    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in\n    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in\n    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was\n    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.\n    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a\n    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about\n    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the\n    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\n    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\n    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\n    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still\n    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.\n\n    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if\n    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near\n    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969\n    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of\n    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium\n    experiments and other chemical releases.

I personally am concerned only with a small lab  \nwith ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  \nadmin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  \nthan a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  \nyour program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   \n\"Pirate board\" or no pirate board.  I too have \"friends\" who blatantly and  \nquite successfuly \"hack\" copy protection schemes practically in their  \nsleep.\n\nLet's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  \nmachine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  \nsetting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  \nmostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  \nadministrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  \n(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and \"acting\" similar to  \nthe average user, and maintaining \"behind-the-scenes\" consistency is a  \nreal headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  \ndifferent folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  \ndisk.\n\nOften we have hardware problems at peak \"business\" times and have to do  \nsome parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .\n\nWell, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..\n\nThe point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  \nfiles etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  \nto do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  \nCOPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  \nmachine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  \nten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  \nthis considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  \nall network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.\n\nOften, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  \nto one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  \nusually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  \nthe original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with \"copy  \nprotection\" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  \n . .\n\nIn short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  \nof like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  \nyou will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  \nguide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  \nREGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  \nthe manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  \nplease take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  \ncosts of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  \nlegitimate user with a \"copy protection\" scheme!\n\n\nSorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)\n\n\nMark S.

(I am almost\nsure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\nwrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel\nlike thinking through it right now.)\n \nWhat is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\nis exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes\n(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals\nmay form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.\nThe reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery\ncharger) is put back into the battery.\n \nLead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each\ncell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts\n(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric\nenergy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it\nhas a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So\nwhile keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.\n \nTo understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\nconcrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's\nPrinciple, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\nact to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivities\nof a some selected materials:\n \n                                              thermal conductivity\n       material           Temperature, C (F)  BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft)\n       --------           ------------------  --------------------\ndiatomaceous earth,            204                   0.051\n natural, across strata        871                   0.077\ndiatomaceous, natural,         204                   0.081\n parallel to strata            871                   0.106\ndiatomaceous earth powder     (100)                  0.039\n  (density, 18 lb/cu.ft)      (200)                  0.042\n                              (300)                  0.044\n                              (400)                  0.048\n                              (500)                  0.051\nconcrete (cinder)              ---                   0.20\n         (stone)               ---                   0.54\n         (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44\npine (across grain)             15                   0.087\n   (parallel to grain)          21                   0.20\noak (across grain)              15                   0.12\nmaple (across grain)            50                   0.11\n \nNote that the thermal conductivity for \"dirt\" (diatomaceous earth) goes down\nwith temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder\nare on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity\nof concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4\ntimes greater than wood.\n \nIt is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on\nconcrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the\ndischarge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity\nor heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)\nDuring storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on\nthe battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity\nsurface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity\nsurface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom\nsurface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,\nthe battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster\nthan that on dirt.\n \nThis is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from\nthe exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the\nreaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that\ntemperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is\na better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner\nof a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which\n\"pulls\" the reaction along.\n \nAlso, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric\nacid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.\n \nJeff White      jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\n \n\"How do I get the ketchup out of my pocket protector?\"  French fries!\n"}

I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, \nwith 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.\n   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is \nbi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip \nnumbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, \nwhich will do you NO good for reading in.\n  \n          Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:\n  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.\n  In pascal, you would \"Write(Port[xxx]);\" where xxx is the address in \neither hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the \nstrobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, \nso for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output \nto these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, \ndo \"Port[xxx]:=value\n\".\n \n                Hope this helps.\n        Let me know if you need more help.\n \n \n  _________________________________________________\n  Inspiration  |   ___                             |\n  comes to     |  \\   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |\n  those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |\n  seek the     |   /-\\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |\n  unknown.     |                                   |\n  ------------------------------------------------- \n \n"}

A\nsociety of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the\ntime and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to\navoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother\nobsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever\npresent.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.\n\n\tAs a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal\nlegal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on\ntechnical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which\nrespects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the\nlaw, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g.\nrequire  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data\ncommunications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption\nthat regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power\nand invade privacy.\n\n\tAs a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  system\noffers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal\nidentifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or\nindustry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by\ncitizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.\nAt best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most\nwould opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would\nnever use or benefit from it.\n\n\tFinally where there's a  will, there's  a  way. If  government\nwants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure\nof various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it\nfor data bases which the government wants to link.      Since\ncorporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one\nanother, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted,\nwill use \"fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes\nused by their customers to other firms.\n\n\tThe solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits\non government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual\nautonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to\noverride it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such\nconsensus.\n\n\n\n                                            Sincerely Yours,\n\n                                             /Sig/\n\n                                            Jerry J.

I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her\nhand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with\nannoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV\ncatheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained\nof the pain.

Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus \nin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors \nin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may \nbe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care \nto comment?).\n\nMost stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, \nI don't think that there are many drugs that can help \"dissolve\" the \nkidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium \nhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the \naterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could \nspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that \na diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery \nis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second \nopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break \nup the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are \nnotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  \nMy condolences to your friend. \n\nMarty B.\n"}

TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the \nstandard are classified but there is open source information to the effect \nthat either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be \nexploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic \nfield associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.\n\nAmong other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the \nprinter head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the \ncrudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some \nintelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential \nsources of leaked information.\n\nWhere cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection \nbecomes an important security hazard.\n\nIn the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns, \nparticularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST \nthreat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the \n'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' \nfor while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to \napproved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified.

I got my\nfirst one in college about 5 or so years ago.\n\n\tI've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for\npast 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I\ngot software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister\nand father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go\nfor one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).\nThe original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would\nsay that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one\n(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.\n\n\tMy brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it\nto him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief\nadvantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:\n\nAdvantages:\tQuick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's\nprinting), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,\nso look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet\nAppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one\nDW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to\ncolor or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I\nreceived many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp\nlaser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those\nImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25\nper sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all\nhours of the night....)\n\nDisadvantages.\tInk used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and\nwasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink\n(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and\nrunning (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your\nbookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts\n(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to\n$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but\nI don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of\nabout 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after\nfooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing\ndoesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the\npaper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.\nOther disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in\nspeed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press\nsoftware solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but\nthey won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.\n\nIn the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript\n(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even\nwhen soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only\ninstance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board\nTransparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser\nPostscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB\nnegatives directly onto a transparency.\n\nWell, hope my babbling has helped.\n-squish@endor.harvard.edu\n\n"}

Dept. - New Mexico Tech\nLines: 46\nNntp-Posting-Host: baltic\n\n\n\tFor a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful\nwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also\npretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of\nbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\n\n\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So\nI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly\nand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually\nfelt refreshed the next morning.\n\n\tSo,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and\nexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am\npresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\ndosage level to try.\n\n\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)\n\n\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of\nantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use\n(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by\nmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be\na serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,\nwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have\ntried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to\nlower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some\nkind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in\nany other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried\nmany of the non-pharmacological solutions)\n"}

From my\ndiscussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 other\ntimes has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the people\nsimply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence for\ndeclaring things classified *after* it has been published.  While I was\nworking on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works\nand I developed a method for tracking particle beams.  It was good enough\nto classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend from\nCanada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping\ncross sections, but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed\nto present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in an\nopen journal without problems.\n\nWhen the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro.  The feds can do whatever\nthey want whenever they feel like it, and they will make up rules to let\nthemselves get away with it.  Since the mass media can't tell the difference\nbetween a joke and the real thing (like \"ranch appocolypse\" for the Waco\nmassacre) don't count on them to help spread the word about their loss\nof freedom.

Where would medicine be if \nconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard \nmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?\nThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very \nimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria \nafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason \nto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply \nand safely(like it is in animal husbandry).\n\nMarty B.\n\n"}

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in\nquantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info\nabout simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest\nMims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with\nresistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math\nto get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a\n555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate\ndoing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz\nto about 500 KHz (I think).\n\nAbout the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to\nuse one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio\nline (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.\n\nThe data line is probably most easily done\nby some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565\nchip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing\nabout how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp\ninformation can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack\ninfo-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.\nSetting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I\nwould suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is\ngoing into, so I am really generalizing...\n\nAs for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I\nsuggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder.

When this line was true, the other boards\ncould all hold off and not send their data.

This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it\nused to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS\nor slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex\nthe data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first\nparagraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more\nthan 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be\nable to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)\n\nYou might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,\nthough.

But before I do, I want to \nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \na problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you \nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When \nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin \nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \nplan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as \nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \nregular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her \ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \nscheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\n\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \nminerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't \nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new \nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \nhandle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\nI'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \ndon't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \nthat I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a \nfew with an axe to grind.  That's life.\n\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \nchelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \nfor all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \ndo any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \nType II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there \nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is \nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \nconcerned\n\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \nthis possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \nfound in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the \nRBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\n\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \nanalysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny \nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\n\nHere's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \navailable(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\n\nWhat's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook \nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \ntolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you \nvery much.\n\nMarty B.\n"}

I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used \n    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is \n    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.\n    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug\n    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute \n    it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this\n    distinction becomes important.\n\n2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible \n\tdiagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something\n\tpeople associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or\n\tunpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.  \n\tOne of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual\n\tcan and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they\n\tare an unending source of anxiety.  \n\tThe obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with \n\tOCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to\n\ta superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.\n\n\tSome references (one non-technical and several technical)\n\tthat someone was kind enough to supply for me\n\tbut was unable to post themself :\n\n|\"The boy who couldn't stop washing\" by judith rapaport.   ***\n\n\t(technical refs) :\n\n|\tpharmacotherapy of o-c disorder\n|\tdonna m jermain and lynn crismon\n|\tpharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-198\n\n|\tepidemiology of ocd\n|\tseteven a rasmussen and jane eisen\n|\tj clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-13\n\n|\tthe waking nightmare: an overview of ocd\n|\tjudith l rapoport\n|\tj clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-28\n\n|\tabsence of placebo response in ocd\n|\tmatig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olson\n|\tj nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. 4\n\n\tAnd thanks very much to those who supplied constructive  \n\tcriticism to my first post on OCD.

I try very hard to keep her\noff antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would\nhave antibiotics.

Noring has pointed out\nthe catch-22 that if the \"crazy\" theory were true, you probably couldn't\nfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie\nbeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\nmany of them appear to get better.  \n\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any\nbetter than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \n\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\noxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that\ndoesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\nhave been talking about.\n\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,\nit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can\nmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough\nmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind\nstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out\nthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can\nadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study\nshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.\n\nKen\n-- \n\n"}

I'd\n> \tlove to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such\n> \tlow volume :-)\n\nMost commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;\nthat's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a \nlinearly-regulated power supply would be considered the \"filter\" caps,\ncoming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a \ntransformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although\nthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT\nnegligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to\nget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a\n\"snubber\" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended\nfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)\n\nThe basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in\na somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a\nhigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or\n\"filter\") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.\nThe transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,\nresulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which \nare then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs\nis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,\nwhich acts in a \"pulse-width modulation\" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying\nthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and\ntherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs\nmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less\ntracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear\nregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the \nregulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)\nis not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various\nsafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be\nelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator\nto meet this requirement.\n\nWhile the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these\ndesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can\nbe ignored; besides the inductive \"kick\" giving the switch transistor a\nbad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the\nenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.\nIn some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,\nyou need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't\nsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the \nimagination! :-)).\n\nI'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; \nhopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors\nin the above.\n\n\nBob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not\n                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other\nmyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.\n"}

You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object\n(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  In the case\nof an object with no significant internal heat production, this will\naffect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if\nit started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final\ntemperature.\n\nFor the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not\nwhether water will freeze.\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"}

It's a bit more complicated than\n    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing\n    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited\n    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.

You should\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \n complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)\n you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\n\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\n  \n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\n\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\n \n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\n are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine \n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\n The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'\n  \n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\n \n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \n\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\n \n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\n\n   -- Ron Roth --\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.\n---\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363\n"}

I'm\n>trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated.\n>Thanks.\n\nYou've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which\nare used for chemotherapy.\n\nThe overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of\nthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy\ncancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different\neffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than\none drug at a time.\n\nSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle\nof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.\n\nThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis\nand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.\nThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized \naagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.\n\nThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.\nOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.\nAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells\nto stop growing.\n\nIf what you are seeking is \"practical\" advice, I apologize for rambling\non the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs\nare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to \nexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small\nfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter\nknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines\ntthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications \ncan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.\n\nProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always\nhappen.

Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer \nhere.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human \nnutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do \nwhen candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community.\nI think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the \nmark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and \ntheir husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that \nmost physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by \ndiet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting \nyour flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is \njustified.\n\nFrom A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition:\n> \tIn a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got \n> sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared\n> by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar\n> intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms.\n> \tIs there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey?\n> \n> Many thanks,\n> \n> Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got \nside-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most \nphysicians don't recognize it as a specific \"disease\" entity.  Here is \neverything that you would ever want to know about PMS.\n\nPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:\n\n\tPMT-A(Anxiety)\t\tPMT-D(depression)\n\tanxiety\t\t\tdepression\n\tirritability\t\tforgetfulness\n\tinsomnia\t\tconfusion\n\tdepression\t\tlethargy\n\n\tPMT-C(Craving)\t\tPMT-H(Hyperhydration)\n\tcraving for sweets\tweight gain\n\tincreased appetite\tbreast congestion and tenderness\n\tsugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness\n\t 1. headache\t\tedema of the face and extremities\n\t 2. palpitations\n\t 3. fatigue or fainting\n \nPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low \nprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.\n\nPMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple \ncarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is \nincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose \nchallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are \na low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia \nis not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of \nhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.\n\tA. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).\nUnrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium \nsupplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of \nthe total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources \nof alpha linoleic acid.\n\nPMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \nphase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead \ntoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \nphase). \"Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human \nendometrial cystol\" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).\n\nPMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated \nserum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E \nfor breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H\n\nThis general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:\n\n\tA. \"Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for \n\t    a nutritional approach\". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. \n\t    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.\n\n\tB. \"Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension \n\t    syndromes\", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).\n\n\tC. \"Premenstrual tension\", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)\n\nTreatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can \nfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one \nthat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, \nsupplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really \nhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida \nblooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental \ncontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to \nsee done).\n\nHere are a few of these studies:\n\n\tCARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, \"Effect of a low-fat, \n\thigh-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy\" Lancet \n\t2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy \n\tof at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive \n\tspecific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories \n\tand increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary \n\tadvise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant \n\treduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in \n\tthe trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as \n\tphysical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, \n\ttenderness and nodularity.\n\n\tVITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, \"The use of Vitamin A in \n\tpremenstrual tension\" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  \n\t218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU \n\tvitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored \n\tand high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of \n\ttoxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the \n\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool \n\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this \n\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose \n\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% \n\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.\n  \t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS \n\tsymptoms.\n\n\tExperimental Controlled Study, \"Premenstrual tension treated with \n\tvitamin A\" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts \n\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their \n\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.\n  \tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in \n\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of \n\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year \n\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms \n\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the \n\tvitamin A supplementation was stopped.\n\nMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  \nThese studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal \nstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins \ngiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best \nsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid \n(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full \nof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent \nthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying \nto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin \nA toxicity.\n\n\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, \"Pyridoxine\n\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover \n\ttrial\"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 \n\twith moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.\n  \tAfter 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another \n\t3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of \n\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS \n\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The efects of vitamin B6 \n\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms\" Obstet. Gynecol \n\t70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received \n\t150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence \n\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related \n\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as \n\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)\n  \tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 \n\tsupplementation.\n\nVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control \npills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  \nWomen on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per \nday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. \nRubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in \nClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be \nconsidered the \"first-line\" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the \npatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin \nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each \nday. \n\n\n\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Efficacy of alpha-\n\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome\" J. Reprod. \n\tMed. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 \n\tcycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a \n\tsignificant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast \n\ttenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant\n \treduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% \n\thad a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo \n\tgroup.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant\n\tdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The effect of alpha-tocopherol on \n\tpremenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study\" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. \n\t2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly \n\treceived vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After \n\t2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly \n\timproved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly \n\timprove PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H\n\t(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve \n\tPMT-H symptoms).\n\t\n\tMAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Magnesium prophylaxis \n\tof menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium\" Headache \n\t31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg \n\tdaily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a \n\tplacebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and \n\tcontinued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index \n\twas significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment \n\twas also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual \n\tDistress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  \n\tlymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower \n\tin this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer \n\tfrom PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised \n\tinto the normal range.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Oral Magnesium successfully \n\trelieves premenstrual mood changes\" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). \n\t32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid \n\t360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the \n\tonset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received \n\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \n\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the \n\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were \n\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on \n\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by \n\tmagnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium \n\tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes \n\tthat occur during PMS.\n\nThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in the \nmedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder \nthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But \nsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. \nto be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are \nalso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on \nmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the \nbest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out \nthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize \nnutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, \npellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor \nbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS \nis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional \ndisorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.\n\nHere's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral \nsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.\n\n\tExperimental Study, \"Effect of a nutritional programme on \n\tpremenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis\", Complement. Med. \n\tRes.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and \n\tsupplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, \n\tmagnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to \n\ttake the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate \n\tdiet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an \n\timprovement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that \n\tthey no longer suffered from PMS. \n\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Role of Nutrition in managing \n\tpremenstrual tension syndromes\", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  \n\tA low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite \n\tsupplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet \n\tchange and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the \n\tvitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased \n\testradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel \n\tphase of their cycle.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Clinical and biochemical effects \n\tof nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome\", J. \n\tReprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 \n\ttablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a \n\tsignificant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another\n \tgroup of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this \n\tsecond group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on \n\tPMS symptoms was observed.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 W. 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok 74107\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\" \n"}

Message-digest algorithms\nhave many applications, including digital signatures and message\nauthentication.\n\nRSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\nRivest \\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\nComputing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\nsecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\em proved}\nsecure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\nto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\noperations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\none has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\n\nRecent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\cite{den-boer-md5} presents\na special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\ninternal compression function, which maps\na 512-bit message block $x$ and a\n128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\nstate. They show how to find a message block $x$\nand two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\noutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\nexploits structural properties of the collision function to find \na pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\nwould expect.\n\nPractical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\nMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\npseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\npseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\ncollision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\nalways involve {\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\n$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\nmessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\ngenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\nthe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\nextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\nspecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\n\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\nBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\nMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\nand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\ncourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\nother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\nsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plain}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\n\n\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\nBert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\n\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\n\\newblock In {\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\n\\newblock Preprint.\n\n\\bibitem{rfc-md5}\nR.L.

Note that weight gain is usually\na symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid\ncondition is present.\n\nI don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,\nbut I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is\ncaused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical\nimbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular\neveryday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the\nbody at all.\n\nThe pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)\non the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -\none is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in\nthe liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other\nhormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the\nbody's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but\nthe liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in\nshort order.\n\nGood sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's\nreference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)\nand the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local\nlibrary).\n\nI hope this has been of some help.\n\n-Eileen Bauer\n"}

The study\n didn't say that, it only claimed that \"most kidney stones are large-\n ly calcium.\"\n Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact\n opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they\n are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.\n \n Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still \n the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention \n of kidney stones.\n I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in\n one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney\n stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE\n in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium\n type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit\n from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!\n\n     Ron Roth\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n * A stone on the ground is better than a stone in the body.\n---\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363\n"}

As this discharge takes place two things\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\n\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\n\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\nare for the most part useless.

So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing \nby this \"hated\" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\nElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.\nA book that you should be familiar with and not \"hate\". \"Candida species \ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \nit.\n\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: \"However, some factors, such as \nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \n\n\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

If you \nnoticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point \nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of \nGreek.

There seems\nto be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of\nunderstanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them\n(as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpret\nevents in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good\nat understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information\nabout them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be\nclarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper had\nI not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET,\nlet alone Internet access?\n\nFor access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging.\nMany folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not\nhave TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong,\nso are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that is\nthe way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren't\nTOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the\nproblem.\n\nAnd then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service\n(bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political\nconnections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if\nany rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their\npolticial or financial gain.

In this post on depression, I'm \nlaying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have \nsome knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, you \nshould know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future.\n\nIn article <123552@netnews.upenn.edu>, lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Lida Chaplynsky) writes:\n> \n> A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on\n> by menopause as well as a mental break down.

Both my wife and I suffered from \nbouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had \"cured\" her PMS using \nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and \nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \nby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \nsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to \"cure\" depression.  I'm not going to do that \nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\n\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \nan approach which will \"fix\" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \nvery important.\n\nLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to \ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming \nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \nMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because \nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \nmy students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:\n\nIndroduction and Carbohydrates \t\t\tLipids\n\nProteins I\t\t\t\t\tProteins II\n\nEnergy Balance\t\t\t\t\tEvaluation of Nutritional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStatus I, A Clinical \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerspective\n\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional\t\t\nA Biochemical Perspective\t\t\tStatus III, Homework \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAssignment Using the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNutritionist IV Diet and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Analysis Software \n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogram\n\nWeight Control\t\t\t\t\tFood Fads and Facts\n\nAge-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements\tFood Additives, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tContaminants and Cancer\n\nDrug-Nutrient Interactions\t\t\tMineral and Water Balance\n\nSodium, Potassium and Chloride\t\t\tCalcium, Magnesium and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhosphorus\n\nIron\t\t\t\t\t\tZinc and Copper\n\nIodine and Fluoride\t\t\t\tOther Trace Minerals\n\nVitamin A\t\t\t\t\tVitamin E\n\nVitamins D and K\t\t\t\tVitamin C\n\nThiamin and Niacin\t\t\t\tRiboflavin and Pyridoxine\n\nPantothenic and Folic acids\t\t\tBiotin and B12\n\nOther Nutrient Factors\t\t\t\tEnteral Nutrition\n\nParenteral Nutrition\n\nEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature \nto find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this \nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \nI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).\n\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\n\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \nto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \npatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \nPreface of this new text:\n\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \n\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\n\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\n\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \nevery organ system.\"\n\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \n\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act).  \n\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \nto be the best approach to depression.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

(email: fw@world.std.com)\nMy thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from\nOracle Corp.\n\nThe most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit \nfeatures or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$\nincluded suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to \nuse table views to refine the granularity of access control.\n\nOne important security consideration in networked installations\nis that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user\nauthentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the \n_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably \nnot define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access \nof OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle \nservers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv\noption), while relying on host security for local processes. \n\nInternally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) \naudit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and\ndata access. These tools can be used to track the primary security\nrisks from within the Oracle environment.\n\nOracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES\nencryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone\nto cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate \nsince the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users \nchoose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access \nto your oracle database files through the host operating system, \ns/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply \ncryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.\n\nAs security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.\nCertainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,\ns/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break \nthe passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without\nalerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail\nwhich would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)\nprovides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not \nguessable. \n\nAs with all computer security, the most important defense is to \neducate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques\nare well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, \n(both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System \nSecurity (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992) \n\n\n\nForrest Whitcher                 fw@world.std.com\nBoston Scientific Corp.

Closest to\n   \"conventional\" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching\n   by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at\n   least it was a good try...\n\nSo you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?\nRecent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star\nhypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for\nimplausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of\nmodels.\n\nA paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came\nthrough the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this\npaper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject\nline \n  get 9304001\n\n\nHere is the abstract of that paper.\n\n   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \\GRBs puts them\n   at cosmological distances;\n   but as long as there is no distance\n   indicator to these events all possible sources which are\n   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is\n   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\n   although there is no known mechanism for generating \\GRBs\n   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\GRBs\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\n\n   We use the available data on the distribution of \\GRBs (the BATSE\n   catalogue up to March, 1992), and\n   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\n   between the angular distributions of \\GRBs and comets' aphelia,\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\n   at least to some extent, true variations\n   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\vov$\n   test to both distributions.\n\n   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a\n   $\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D\n   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for\n   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.\n   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but\n   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any\n   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations\n   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\sim 800$\n   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\n   Currently,\n    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement\n   found for the $\\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort\n   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\GRBs.\n"}

First, let me\nflame the famous Dave S. : He's obviously only 10 years old.  Cut him\nsome slack. :^}\n\nThe joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice job\nguys!  I've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years\nnow, Clinton's actions so far have really helped.  But because of\ngovernment action taken against various other groups, I have developed\na 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list.\nThe S-boxes are the critical component, and since I chose 32 out of 57\nbased on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason it\nslows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a\ndifferent set of s-boxes, I know it's only a vector, but it sure makes\nrandom search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have had\ntheir mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug\nuse/sales.  It's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org,\n*but* you will be watched.\n\nIt really is important to write a letter to every official you\npersonally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by\nthe \"cripple chip\".  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get\n*enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, and\nthe IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we\n*are* seeing some changes.\n\nIt's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the\nimplimentation decision being made behind our backs.  As Vesselin\npoints out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be\nagain depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns\nand \"law abiding\" citizens don't, and criminals like me have marijuana\nand \"law abiding\" subjects don't, criminals like me will have secure\ncrypto while \"law abiding\" robots don't.  PGP is nice, but as time goes\non we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.\n\nSomeone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He's my favorite dude.\n500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain\nthat to \"princes\" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted\n(I've got \"The Prince\" at home, so I'll just paraphrase :) ) had to do\nwith conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*\nit.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept\nthe people's customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a people\nwill remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive\ngovernment.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*\nThomas Jefferson.\n\nThere were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic\nis watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords\nlike marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are known\nsubversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if\nyou know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it's pretty easy\nto go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the\nless you're noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization\nwhich can diseminate truth to the masses.\n\nWhich gets me to the thread about a \"public encrypted conference\".\nThat's just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an\ninfiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you're doing.  It will be\nfun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it's\npretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where\nyou get your marijuana.\n\nGuns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in\ngovernment who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says in\nalt.drugs \"Live free or don't\".  Machiavelli pointed out that's just\nhow most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.\nIt's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as\nIntergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the\nU.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots\ncalled bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might\nthink.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be\nhurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.\nde Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the\nmajority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.\n\nAnd given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne\nNational Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.\n\nPatience, persistence, truth,\t\twork: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.gov\nDr. mike\t\t\t\thome: mrosing@igc.org\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQBVAgUBK9hETK3mm/E84rLHAQFV+gH9ExvzfXbNR4x0BTg2nQIxB5/ZMaxT289B\nG4QjTsv8mszMrzU1DcJ8eLIQ37BwX53jATBH9U4B/biqmGKiPzHCmA==\n=S3hf\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}

The system may\nnot rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but\nit is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some\nsuspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys\nfrom escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's\ncoercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone.\n\nI will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.\nThe original title perhaps should have been \"Distinction between legal\nand illegal cipher systems considered harmful\", but \"Clipper considered\nharmful\" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n  1.  Clipper is made available.\n\n  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\n      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\n      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\n      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\n      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\n      detection a cause for further action.\n\n  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\n      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\n      some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and\n      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\n      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\n      red flag.\n\n  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\n      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\n      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones.\n\n  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\n      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\n      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\n      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\n      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\n      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\n      each one has a unique unit key.\n\n  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\n      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\n      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\n      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\n      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\n      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\n      immediate suspicion.\n\n  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\n      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\n\nBy #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\nphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one's\nassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\naround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\nassociated with someone else.\n\nA non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\ncommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\nor steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from\nreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\ncommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\nbut the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\nor abandoning the phone before T elapses.\n\nIt would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\nphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone\nelse's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion.\n\nThis leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\nand collusion.\n\nCoercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\na low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\na car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\nfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\narise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\ncriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\nwho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\ncommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\nThe limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\nthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\nfreshly coerced phones.\n\nThere would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\nwealthy criminals, and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money,\nand who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\nphone service for someone else's use.\n\nCriminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\nClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\ncellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\ntheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use being coerced must\nfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\nhave its keys obtained from escrow.\n\nClipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\nconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\nmechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\ncan validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\nin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\nwhich we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\npieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\n\nWhereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\nwould stand out, a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\nmedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\nrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\nchip is fractured.\n\nIf you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\nthe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be\nusing someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you against\nwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\nable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\nidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\n\nThe gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\nthey were before Clipper came along.\n\nI therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\n\n  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\n      aggressive or dishonest government.\n\n  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\n      criminal threat to the honest public.\n\n  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\n      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\n      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\n      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\n\n  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors\n      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime\n      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key\n      escrow is claimed to help against.\n\n  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting\n      of \"illegal\" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher\n      machine...\n\nBrad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!brad\nPetaluma, CA\n"}

But she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ...\n\nThe situation in cipher feedback (CFB) mode is a bit more complicated but  \nsimilar and left as an exercise for the reader :-)\n\nFinally there is the modified output feedback mode (OFB) where DES (or  \nwhatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by\n\n   s[i] = E(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0],\n\nand encryption is given by\n\n   c[i] = m[i] XOR s[i].\n\nHere the usual `known plaintext' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers  \nreduces the cracking to key search for K.\n\n--\nKlaus Pommerening\nInstitut fuer Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation\nder Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitaet\nObere Zahlbacher Strasse 69, W-6500 Mainz, Germany\n"}

I have\n>not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been\n>reported, but I could have easily missed it.\n\nPlease let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality\nof other strong cryptosystems.   So far any references I have seen\nhave been weasel-words (\"more plans in the future, etc\"), but nothing\nthat could be taken as a \"NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)\".  I\nhave heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has\nlanguage that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard\nall systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystems\nnot trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys\nwhich one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by\nfolks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either\n'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY\nbut by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY\noutlawed for all intents and purposes.\n\nNow, for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care, hit 'n' now.\n\nCrypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY\noutlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers,\nscrewdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much\nat the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual\npossessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine\nuse of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need'\n(gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught\nusing them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'.\nIn other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely\nsensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong\nsecurity, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,\nnot personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.\nA personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as\na 'legitimate NEED': \n\"Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate law\nenforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so\nconcerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal\nsecrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning\nto conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING\nTO HIDE, HMMMM?\"\nI expect that initially there will be some people selected either at\nrandom, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of\n'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about\nthis... (mega ':-('s)\n\nOne asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that\nthere is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an\nargument used in the abortion debate):  \"You do NOT have a right to have\nsecurity that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'\" (as suggested\nin the Clipper Press Release).\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only\nfor crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set,\nlaying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both\nsafe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately\nowned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...\n\nI cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those\n'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily\ndeclared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It would\nsimply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A\nsimple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are\nmainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents\nwould go something like:\n\n\"We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank\naccount, (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you\nhave a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your\nacquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers\ntools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no\ndecent American Subject would be against these noble causes...\".\n\n\"Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying\nyour HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing\nSOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these 'terrorist tools'.\nOnly a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>\".\n\n\"Therefore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT\napply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>\".\n\n\"If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to court to\nPROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools'\nand again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead,\nwe have no problem with that!  'Course, with your bank assets seized,\nno car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and your\nless-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practical\ndifficulties <grin>...\".\n\nTHAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY how\nthe logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been\nused to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on\nthe property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff in\nthat dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for\ndealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust another\nday, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets...\n\nOb Disclaimer (of course)...\n\nOk, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base these speculations\non what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture\ncases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies,\nor to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or who\ndo not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where\nthey are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the means to be\nable to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East,\nlike NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA).  These people have the\nchoice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threats\nof pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case...\nAll behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behind\nthe Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'.\n\nPoint is, are these speculations way out of line, or are they all too\ntypical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anything\nthat the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable?  And if not\nwhy not (what are our guarantees, besides the government promises)?\n\nNONE?\n\n>Ted Lee\n>Trusted Information System, Inc.                        tmplee@tis.com\n>PO Box 1718 \n>Minnetonka, MN 55345\n\n-- \npat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA\n         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat\nWISDOM: \"Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,\n         and I am not sure about the former.\"              - Albert Einstien\n"}

Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,\nsometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,\nsometimes they find it's incurable.  \n\nThere is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an \nillness.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\n\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\n\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\n\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\n\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\nmini-sequence.\n\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\n\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC\n\n1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the\nsequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.\nIn the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated\nin the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command\nprocess.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial\nRRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the\nstator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the\nRRA slew test.\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n"}

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline \nsearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since \ncommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or \nbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.\nThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are \nrecommended rather than yogurt.\n\nI guess the next question is why would this introduction of \"good\" bacteria \nback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the \nanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy\ndenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \nlooses it's major food source.\n\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \nbeen used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in \nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\n\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But \nthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty \nhot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only \nwell established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or \ndo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to \nwork yet?\n\nMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they \ninvolve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into \nthe gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other \nis getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a \nproblem with recurring yeast infections.\n\nMarty B.\n"}

BATSE is an altogether different\nbeast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of \nthe craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the \ndifferential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.\nPositional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors\nand errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have\nany independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to\ndetermine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small \ncomponent to the positional error.  \n\nDemonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would \nrequire resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort \ncloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together \nnow: \"Parallax ARc SECond\", a parsec is the distance of an object \nthat demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).\nIf the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to \nhave to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.\n\nThe beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and\nwatches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination\nwhen you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.\n\n-Kevin\n"}

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung \ndisease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side\n-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also \nbinds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when \nEDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that \nwere not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove \ncalcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C \nand magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra \nvitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium \nfrom the plaques).\n\nThe calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably \ncan be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns \nwith calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.\n\n\t1. \"Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review\"\n\t   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).

I'll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it's a\nbit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the\nprotocol that's followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get a\nwiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption\nand the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, is\nsent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The\nF-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the\nencrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They, in turn, use U1\nand U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.\n\nNote how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the\ncops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can't read other traffic.  Every\nrequest must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  The\ncops and the FBI together can't cheat, since they don't have U.  (I\nregard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the\nsystem.  It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme.)  The\nescrow agents can't read the conversation, since they don't have it;\nall they have is N and U[K].  And the police don't even see N.\n\nIt's harder to see how to block decryption of old, warrantless,\nwiretaps.  There is one protection -- you have to persuade the escrow\nagents that the call is current.  But that's not nearly as strong.\nThere are approaches I can see that might work, involving sequences of\ndata on an unalterable medium, complete with cryptographic protection\nagainst insertion onto a new medium.  But I don't have anything yet\nthat isn't too complex for comfort, or too hard to install in the real\nworld.  The NSA might have an answer; they may or may not be smarter\nthan me, but I've been working on this for a week, and they've had years.\n"}

There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a\n4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scanned\nimages of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it for\nsomething it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.\nTHey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.\nIt is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expand\nthe data base to handle more types of stuff.\n\nThese systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and get\nmonthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back to\nthem so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay a\nyearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.\n\nIf you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on a\npage-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You can\nalso print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Page\nprinting takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dump\nthe 5 or 6 pages you usually need.\n\nI have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available\nto all Internet users.    :-)\n\n  -dave\n\n-- \nDave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com\n                                        37N 17.382    121W 59.190 \n"}

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere\n> evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question\n> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.\n\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\nby itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\nthe resulting reduced material.\n\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\n\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\n\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about\nit.\n\n\tPaul F.
