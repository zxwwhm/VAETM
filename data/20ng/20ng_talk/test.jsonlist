My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save\nourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their\nproblems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked \nin the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left\nin 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to.

We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that\na survivor made this claim.  We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who\nspoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did\nNOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire.  In the absense\nof any more evidence, I don't see how we can decide who to believe.\nFurthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that\nsome small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else.\nWith the state of the area now, we may never know what happened.\n\n|> \n|> >    BD's were not contemplating suecide, and there is no reason \n|> >    to believe they committed one.\n|> \n|> No reason?  How about these two:\n|> \n|> 1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the\n|> \tcorridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spread\n|> \tis not inconsistent with this claim.\n\nAgain, we have only the word of the FBI on this claim.  The lawyers who\nhave also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim.\n\n|> \n|> 2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.\n|> \tThere is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this\n|> \tfire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.\n\nI will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities.  Its more likely\nthat the BD's started the fire than did the FBI.  But there is currently NO\nway to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence\n(which is nearly none).\n\n|> \n|> 3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible that\n|> \tDavid Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that this\n|> \twas not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.\n|> \n|> There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:\n|> \n|> A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of the\n|> \tinadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate this\n|> \tas highly unlikely.\n|> \n|> B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would be\n|> \tfoolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.\n|> \tSure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern\n|> \twhich started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle of\n|> \tthe day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence that\n|> \thas been contradicted by other escapees.\n|> \n|> C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested by\n|> \tsome on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterly\n|> \tludicrous.  This is what we in \"sci.skeptic\" would call an\n|> \t\"extraordinary claim\" and won't bother refuting unless someone gives\n|> \tany good evidence to back it up.\n\n   D.   The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs.  I am truely amazed that\n        I have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility.\n        With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and\n        the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.\n        I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or\n        accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.  With the winds, it\n        would have quickly gotten out of control.\n\n|> \n|> So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBI\n|> accident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter more\n|> likely based on the evidence I've seen so far.\n\n   No, I think that D is also quite reasonable.  I personally can't really\nasses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if\nforced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or\nBD) over intential setting of the fire).\n\n   I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered\nhad gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically\ndenied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intense\nheat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and\nthat this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is\nquite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.\n\n   In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many\nscenarios as to what happened on Monday.  We should remain skeptical until\nmore information is available.  \n\n|> -- \n|> *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)\t*       ___\n|> *\t\t\t\t\t* _____/_o_\\_____\n|> *\tTwinkle, twinkle, little .sig,\t*(==(/_______\\)==)\n|> *\tKeep it less than 5 lines big.\t* \\==\\/     \\/==/\n\n-- \n\nBob Garwood\n"}

It's similar to collecting coins,\nor stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model\ntrains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about\neverything is collected).

And I \nthink that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that \nshould be opposed.  You couldn't help thinking about that.  That's \nnot to compare the two examples.

Islam \n>is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world.

Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\nmade by people on this subject:\n\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\n\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\n\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\nclue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\n\n>the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has \n>kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was \n>changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!\n\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\n\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\n\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\n\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\n\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\ndominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.\n\nSincerely,\n-Josip\n\n\n\n"}

I'm going to count on the supposition that you think\nthrough the opinions you have - something which is, by the way, against\nmy better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date.  We are\nagreed, aren't we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usage\nof a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words and\nphrases which comprise that language?  Now, you are using meanings\ncompletely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically different\nfrom, those given in the dictionary.  As a reference book, a dictionary\ncontains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current\nuse.  That's also why they are updated so often.  Now, if you are saying\nthings which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, and\nusing non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance of\nbeing taken at face value...?\n\nJust about none.  Just about no one will take you that way because the\nwords mean something different to them.

That is their strong suit.\n\tBut the public must question why agents of the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper-\national skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve\nthe 51-day standoff free of flames and fury.\n\tThe loss of life most clearly reflects the demen-\ntia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal\ndelusiosn are now seared on the public conscious-\nness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of\narms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of\nrationality could be expected from Koresh, a self-\nconfsesed \"sinner without equal.\"\n\tWhat continues to mystify are th eactions of\nfederal agents, who bungled the case from the\nstart.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when\n100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-\nbacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent\non seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-\nons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-\nbers died inteh ensuing gun battle.

Fifty-one days into \nthe siege there was no public outcry to storm the\ncompound.\n\tIt had been correctly perceived that the chil-\ndren inside \"Rancho Apocalypse\" were essentially \nhostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no\nreason for the government to be impatient.  The\ngovernment's superior firepower, control of water\nand utilities and freedom of movement created the\nconditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.\n\tNeither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the\nFBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for\nabandondoning the course of patience.\n\tIf intelligence was accurate and Koresh was\ngrowing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-\ncult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an\nM-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-\nports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they\nwould have to be weighted against the potential for\neve ngreated hamr.\n\n\netc etc tec....\n[paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]\n\nBut some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,\nand inexperienced president who did not pay\nenough attention to the life-and -death decisions\nbeing made on WAco.\n\tIf Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would\nbe for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-\nforcement officers--a common problem among\nprosecutors.\n\tFull investigations into th eWaco tragedy must\nbe conducted by both the executive and legislative\nbranches.

The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the\n    intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in\n    this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel, \n    and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a\n    great steaming heap of hatred!\n    \n    You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for\n    objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from \n    their original context so that they can be used to further an \n    agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel.\n\n    You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image \n    of several Israeli leaders.  I can't say if you actually HATE\n    these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do\n    suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.\n    \n    So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an\n    ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is \n    false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident\n    that you hate the Jewish people.\n\n    And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can\n    be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish\n    background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there\n    is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade\n    away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage\n    for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that \n    you hate the Jewish people.\n\n    And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your\n    own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me \n    that you hate yourself.\n                      \n                      *       *       *       *\n\n    \"Who is a Jew?

If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained?\n By:\n\n      1. Propaganda \n      2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination\n      3.

The question of\n  responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman\n  Armenians has evolved into a polemic.

I knew him to be Turkey's man; due to my\n  reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member\n  of the promotion committee. For that case, I sat down and read his entire\n  treatise \"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey\". It took me\n  three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized \n  Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw\n  himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome \n  of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well, I went on leave  \n  and managed to show 40% of Volume I, containing around 5000 sentences, \n  to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages    \n  from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a\n  500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw's plagiarism. \n\n  The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting,\n  promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for \n  all this: upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University\n  structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for\n  permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President\n  of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me\n  permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily,\n  the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more \n  than 150 academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused\n  to attend.

In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy \nCommision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, \"all \nof the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the \nindustrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic \nmaterials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three \nvolcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and \nHekla in Iceland in 1947.\" To which could be added Mount St. Helens in \nWashington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon \ndioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million \ntons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the \nPhilippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into \nthe stratosphere).\nLOS NINOS\nMany environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global \nwarming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in \nBoulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a \nnatural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive \ncurrents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that \nperiodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's \nweather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold \nwater that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for \nthousands of miles.\nCHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: \"Cold water along \nthe equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The \nresult was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped \nBangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and \ndistorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet \nStream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the \nU.S. resulting in drought.\"\nTERMITE TERROR\n\nSundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental \n\"degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in \"the Netherlands... manure \nfrom pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with \nexcessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred \nthe landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are \nravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage \nstanding forrests.\"\nThe February 1983 issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that \"an international \nteam of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the \nCarbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does.\" According to a study reported in \nSCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the \"estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide \nproduced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil \nfuel combustion.\" In addition, \"Termites are a potentially important source \nof atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global \nemmisions.\" The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too \ndigest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, \nmethane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.\nAnts are another natural source of \"pollution.\" In 1987, an atmospheric \nchemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, \nreported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities \nof the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in \nremote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the \nglobe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the \nrain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT \nmagazine, the \"ants release the acid when defending themselves and \ncommunicating with each other and upon dying. Since  30 percent of the world \nant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about  \nthe acid the ants release,\" an amount estimated at \"600,000 metric tons \nannually.\" which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of \nautomobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation.\"\nClearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a \"despoiler\" of the \nenvironment.\nBy Robert W.

Why have\n>you omitted that level from your model?\n\nYes, and the individual is not omitted; I just didn't fully articulate the \nprinciples of Fractal Federalism.  All government powers derive from the\nPeople; each level can receive a new power from the level below through \nthe amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes \nthat power into the Constitution of the level above (in the case of the \nlowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case \nof higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures.  We can\nof course haggle about the specifics of \"true consensus\" when we hold our \nConstitutional Convention :-).  Once a power has been granted, it may be \nexercised by the legislature.  Powers not in the original Constitutions must \npercolate upward, starting from the individual.  The ratification process \nfor the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a \nplurality or majority.\n\nGranting a \"right\" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering\nthe government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments\nat the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process \n(again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government \nstructure).\n\nThis government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read-\n\"liberals\") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government\nto force people to do \"good\" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it \nis difficult to reach a consensus on).  It is also a frustrating structure \nfor those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- \n\"big-government conservatives\").  I personally would rather see those types\nof people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and \neconomic) that is going on now.\n\nThis is IMHO a \"good\" government stucture for those who see the role of\ngovernment as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing\nthat individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that\nthey live in.\n\n\n>> 2) A free market works on government, not just economics.  Succesful\n>> ideas propogate, unsuccessful ideas die.\n\n>What is your definition of a \"successful\" idea or a \"successful\"\n>government?\n\nOne which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its\npeople, while working within the realities of human nature.  You do bring\nup the point (intentional or not) that a \"lasting\" idea is by no means\nnecessarily a \"successful\" idea.  I believe that Fractal Federalism would\nat least bring many ideas to light, and The People would have the opportunity\nto democratically choose between \"good\" ideas and \"bad\" ideas.  If the\nDocialists, er, I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a\nprosperous People, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to  \ncheck their thesis.  If Libertopia is possible, it will arise.  If a balanced\nConservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of\ngovernment activity, it will become clear to The People that it is best.\n\n\n\n>> As far as \"set the moral tone\" is concerned, if a community does not\n>> collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of\n>> their kids, why should they have to?

That is how the Federal \nGovernment is supposed to work now, but the Supreme Soviet, er, I mean the \nSupreme Court put a stop to that \"republican government\" nonsense.\n\nIn my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provision\nempowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever\nlevel we are talking about) could indeed ban churches.  The constitutional\nprovision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision\nprotecting free exercise of religion.  The uppermost Constitution is still\nthe Supreme Law of the Land.\n\n\n\n>(I find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free-market\n>competition among various ideas, and yet support the right of he\n>majority in a community to suppress ideas which they don't like.)\n\nIt is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations\nand environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas.\n\nOne dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, and\nthey also need to have some control over their environment.  In my\n\"Fractal Federalism\" government, certain \"rights\" are protected by the \nconstitutions.  Other \"rights\" are protected simply because the government \nhas not been empowered to infringe upon them.  When a consensus is reached\nthat the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringed\nupon.  This cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom,\nbut I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes\nare a good idea.\n\nI am sure that many parents believe that they have a \"right\" to control\nthe environment that their children live in.  People feel that they have\na \"right\" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances.\nThere are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential\nneighborhoods.  I do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual\ninstances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), I view them\nas the people in a community having some control over the type of community\nthat they live in.  I see the alternative as near anarchy.\n\nLike I said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an \nindividual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero\neffect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right\nto restrict that activity.  There are simply not very many behaviors that\nfit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomes\nan issue of one individual or group having power over another individual\nor group.  I think that the \"Fractal Federalism\" approach is a sound, if\nnot ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power.  The libertarian \nscenario degenerates to \"might makes right,\" and the system we have right\nnow is one of \"lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what \npowers the government should have by subverting the democratic process \nthough the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\n\n>> The problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the\n>> fundamental dilemma of democratic government: The People have a right\n>> to exercise a voice in their community, yet individuals have the right\n>> to be left to themselves.  This is a serious dilemma precisely because\n>> there is not much that takes place in a vacuum.\n\n>Oddly enough, if what you say is taken literally there is little or no\n>conflict: the people do indeed have a right to exercise a voice -- where\n>\"voice\" equals \"persuasive speech\" in their communities... it's only\n>when they somehow get the idea into their heads that they also have a\n>right to dictate behavior in their communities that the trouble begins.\n\nI think I answered this above already, but let me expand a little more\nwith an example.  If I stand naked in front of your house and masturbate \nin front of your children while they play, in your libertarian (small 'l')\nscenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me.  \"Autonomous\" is\na value judgement 99.99% of the time, it is not a scientific reality with\na clear definition.  Exactly who would you empower to make that value\njudgement?\n\n\n\n>[stuff deleted]\n\n>> Certainly not the only cause, Mike, but people in a local neighborhood\n>> should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood.

I am truly interested if you have\nany improvements to make on my ideas (I call them \"my ideas\", but they\nall come from an \"average guy\" reading of the U.S. Constitution without\nbenefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia).\n\n\n\n>But I have to say that I think that your solution is at least just as\n>bad.

When I said that \"Fractal Federalism\" \nresembles the U.S. constitution, I meant it and thought it was pretty clear.  \nI should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government\npower is from the CONSENSUS of the people (although not the CONSENT of every\nindividual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement).  It is certainly \nbetter than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is the\nsituation we have now.  That is why I think the Supreme Court should be\na jury court, with a different jury for each case.  \n\nIt is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still \nfind it a repugnant idea?  If so, what is your solution?\n\n\n\n>> Ideally, everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government\n>> coercive power of any kind would be necessary.

I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a\nconviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the \"fundy\" part as the\nterm fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to\nthose who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and\nwish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it\nmatter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been\nsatisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling\nstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.\n\nWith respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you\nto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume\nthat defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his\nright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'\ntheology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-\nDavidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect\nof the tragic events of the past few days.\n\nNor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the\nfederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting\ninfants so it must be true even though such allegations do not\nfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are\nstate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the\nlocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge having\never been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent\nas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least\nthat's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-\ngandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a\nlustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might\nbring upon him.  \n\nBut evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the\nbuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined\nby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse\nand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with\nDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported that\nthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.\n\nUltimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh\nis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a\nmost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.\nSo I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One\nwho has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left\non earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong\nmessage to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the\npeople it serves.\n\n--Joe Gaut\n\n> \n> (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't\n> put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.

Be careful here...the\n>problem isn't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich\n>rich.\n\n  But the \"values and systems that make the rich rich\" all basically\n  amount to freedom of choice. \n\n  In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family\n  farm.   Farm economy households were economically diversified, producing\n  not only agricultural goods but also \"manufactured\" goods, especially \n  cloth.  Many farm women carded, spun, and/or wove, producing not only\n  cloth for their own family but also to sell, generating extra income.\n\n  But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England\n  and by the 1820's it had moved to the US, in both cases in the form \n  of textile mills.  These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently\n  and cheaply than people at home.  \n\n  The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out\n  and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to \n  go to work in these same mills in Lowell, Mass, or Nashua, NH, where\n  they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening, dangerous conditions, living \n  regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis-\n  eases due to the work.\n\n  Now people didn't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth. \n  They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support\n  their local economy . . . \n\n> Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system\n>and make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit.\n\n  . . . but (sorry for the cliche), \"it takes two to tango\".   The big\n  rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff.\n  It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also \n  its social center.  You KNEW the merchants you did business with \n  or even local kids working behind the counter.   You would see\n  people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat.\n\n  Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop \n  at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of\n  thousands or millions.  You have no particular relationship with the\n  companies you do business with, and feel no particular commitment\n  to them, nor they to you.   Major components of what defines a \"com-\n  munity\" have been destroyed.   On the other hand the products we buy\n  at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign\n  manufacture, and they are probably of better, or at least more consistent,\n  quality.\n\n\n>                                                           I have to\n>constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make\n>money.

A year before the war\nerupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began\nstockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for\nplaces in Israel and Europe for the evacuees.\n \nThey were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the\nshooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind\nwork in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a\nwartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.\n \nThe center, which has been shelled several times along with most of\nSarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food\npackages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.\n \nWhile Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here\nsay there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and\ntolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to\ncenturies of Turkish occupation.\n \nSarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman\nCatholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before\nWorld War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out\nby the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia.

Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \n\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\n\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \n\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\nmanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone's face,\"\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\nmorality. \n\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\nevidence.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's\n    point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be\n    simple and dignified.\n\t\t\t\tDiogenes\n"}

Here are the facts:\n\n\nSource: Walker, Christopher: \"Armenia: The Survival of a Nation.\"\n        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.\n\nThis generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information\nof direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: \n\na) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the \narchitect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected \nof Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic \nin Berlin during World War II; \n\nb) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social \ntheories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members \nof the Aryan 'Super-Race;' \n\nc) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves \nwith the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, \n\nd) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side \nby side with the Wehrmacht.\n\n \nIn fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast \nnetwork of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. \nThousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in \nRussia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and \nfifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. \nThey were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in \nan agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of \nthis agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, \n1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians \nwere aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed \npro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.\n\n\nIn 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi\nconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first\nArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion \nhad grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro \n(the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the \narchitect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds \nbetween 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious \nDashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged \nby this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\n\n\n"}

Egypt expelled most of its community outright. Most of\nthe French North African Jews left rather than face Independence. I think\nthat Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I\nam not sure. Someone else around here will know for sure. There are claims\nthat Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the\nJews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. It would\ntake a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France\n(as most did) or to Israel. Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel. Those\nleft were rumoured to have another airlift last year but I heard nothing\nabout it so I guess it was just a rumour.

But they have been systematically \n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \n\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \n    \n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \n          DATUM\"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson\n          \n               The following is a complete list of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B.

Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and \n          should be available via inter-library loan if your local \n          university or public library doesn't have each of them. \n\n               Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available \n          from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), \n          1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \n          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses \n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \n    \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                       Robert E.

Zoroaster, was The Jewish Discomfort With Jesus\nOrganization: The Duck Pond public unix: +1 408 249 9630, log in as 'guest'.\nLines: 281\n\nIn article <1746.2BD37A66@paranet.FIDONET.ORG> \nBill.Carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bill Carlson) writes:\n> Since everywhere I look, Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable\n> descendant of Daniel; suppose you prove he wasn't.\n\nZoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that,\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\n\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\nsalvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\nmartyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\n\nZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from\nMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The\netymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,\nas uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-\nwhere. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the\nGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old\nIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,\nseveral Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\nWe can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,\nmeans \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used\ntraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when\nZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into\ncommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books\nof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]\n  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in\nWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,\nand heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"),\nattributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the\nAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha\nSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha\nVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the\nprophet's death.\n  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger\nAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the\nPahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid\ninscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is\nmentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who\nseems unaware of him).\n  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true\nchronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect\nway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose\nwas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the\nother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,\nalthough from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him\nsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,\nHermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The\naccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean\nsix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes\nagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes\nreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut\nHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it\nis generally rejected.\n  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are\nnonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history\nof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as\nthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time\nZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an\nextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet\ncould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close\nto, that of the Achaemenids.\n  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-\nlogy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-\ning to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\nAgain, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as\nhistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical\njustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the\nlatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface\nbecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed\nby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the\nbeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex\nproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the\npart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this\ncontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after\nthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and\nVishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium\n(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\n  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to\nreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally\non the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus\nthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the\ngreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of\nthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that\nperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same\ntime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be\njustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-\nthushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the\nmost legitimate.\n  As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of\nvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that\nhe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\nwith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language\nof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,\nboth on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,\neven though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable\nvariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view\nthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian\nregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,\nZarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the\nHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia\n(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would\nthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\n  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna\n33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a\nspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned\nreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an\nathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly\ncaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used\nto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the\nproduct of a great and original ethical mind.\n  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India\nto Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,\nor \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks\ntruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -\nand blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision\nof asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the\n\"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this\nlanguage lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian\nmysticism.\n  Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a\nparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength\nof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-\nfully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic\nmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the\nevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,\nFrashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] \n  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological\ndoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-\ntions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic\nand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem\nof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward\nreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-\ntion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\n  Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to\nunderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the\ncomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the\nAmesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the\nabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous\ndevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a\nsystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the\nmanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]\n  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"),\nand of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of\nZarathushtra's life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\nAccording to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at\nthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful\ninspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did\nhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was\nstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly\ngroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility\ncaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of\nKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with\nhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two\nyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"),\nand of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more\nsons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of\nhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good\ncattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:\nFrashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as the\nhusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"),\nwhose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,\naccording to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was\nassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the\nTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi\nform).\n  The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi-\ntion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian\ncommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of\nthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as\npassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth\ncentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i\nBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about\nZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the\nperfect man.\n  Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the\nRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic\nperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien\nwisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,\npsychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the\ninfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always\nopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and\nadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as\na precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the\nbiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural\nsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three\nMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is\nderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the\nFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the\nSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the\nspread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra's popularity in the\nChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised\noften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three\ngreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture\nand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-\nance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-\nthushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was\nviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean\nOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a\npossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in\nVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\n  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave\nthe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-\n1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the\ntrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between\ngood and evil. [See also Zoroastrianism]\n"}

The ammo and guns were left unsecured.\n\n    \"My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted\n through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and\n stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,\n the safe -- everything was open and laying around.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Okay, today's schedule.  As you know, the \nPresident jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.  \n\t     \n\t     At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the \nRose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award.  At 1:30 p.m., \nhe will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.  And at 5:00 \np.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel.  There will be a photo \nop at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards.\n\t     \n\t     Any questions?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he moving towards some major decision this week \non Bosnia?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As we've said, he's continuing to discuss \nhis options.  He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy \nadvisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.  \nHe'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll \ncontinue to discuss it.  We don't have any specific timetable, but \nobviously the situation there is very serious.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's spoken to her today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly \nexcept on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 \np.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He did.  He answered a question about it \nyesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Before anything had happened.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Before anything happened.  He put out --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since something has happened he's had nothing to \nsay.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's put out a statement on it last night.  \nAnd we'll have more to say about it later today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In what forum is that going to be?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He will talk about Waco at that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, he'll have something to say.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that something we can take live?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will be brief.  We can talk a \nlittle later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I \ndon't know if it's something you'd want to take live.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as \nwell?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the \nAttorney General?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know \nthat he hasn't talked to her this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or \nanyone else?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he didn't talk yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the reaction to her resignation statement \nthat she made last night?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she \nanswered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of \nasking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her \n100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He \ntakes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind \nAttorney General Reno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told \nthat he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much \nhe knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and \nthe justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of \nthat, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the \ncompound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else \nwas going to succeed, et cetera?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about \nthe decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led \nto her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision \nto go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back \nnow, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision \nhe signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at \nwhat actually happened?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is \nlost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the \ndecision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was \ninformed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 \npercent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the \nFBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone \non for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their \nlives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.  \n\t     \n\t     This was a very difficult situation and all the \ndecisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the \nground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving \nforward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the \nbest possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-\nguessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?  They have to --\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I \nthink it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  \nI think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at \nthis -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, \nit's not useful.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You sound like he's going to order an investigation \nof what happened and whether --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that \nlater, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He will order an investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to \nsay about an investigation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely \nthere is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right \ndecision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned \nout to be a rather -- a debacle.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review \nthe situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  \nI don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, \nagain, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and \nwe'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the FBI Director's role in this?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting \nup the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were \non the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke \nto the President, but I'll double-check that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of \nplanning and so forth?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what \naspects he was involved with.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House \ntoday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe \nthat she'll be here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on \non the part of political opposition to make something out of this in \nterms of -- to the President's detriment politically?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people \nwouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I \nthink, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate \nthe facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  \nBut I think people understand that this was a difficult series of \ndecisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused \nby a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four \nfederal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent \n\f\nchildren lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes \nthe tragedy of the outcome.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling \nthe, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was \ntalking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at \nJustice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of \nthing?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end \nof the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the \nnews conference once there was a point at which there was enough \ninformation, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had \ntranspired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of \nlevels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department \nand at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening \nthere.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the \nPresident, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to \nanybody at the White House.  So who --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-\nstaff level.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department \nwas handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, \nWebb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked \nto a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a \nnumber of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into \nexactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number \nof conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to \nkeep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its \nability as events unfolded throughout the day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he \ntalked -- he may have at one point.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And was the White House role just to seek \ninformation about what happened, or was it to direct the public \ninformation campaign that followed?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation \nso the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice \nDepartment managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very \ninterested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the \nPresident was following it very closely throughout the day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was \nfollowing it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet \nReno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her \nthis morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on \nthroughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  \nHe's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning \nbefore events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written \nstatement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to \nher personally yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've \nspoken this morning.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung \nout to dry all day yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said \nthroughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that \nhe stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President \nstands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts \nfull responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that \nJanet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they \ncould, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the \ntime.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her \n1,000 percent.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One of the best indications of that is to pick up \nthe phone and tell her.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken \nthis morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why can't we find out?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here \nright now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do \nis pick up the phone.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered \nor he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to \nincreasing pressure on the Davidians?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  \nAgain, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly \nshe told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it \nwas entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was \nhappening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he \ngave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was \nthat she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She \ninformed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't \nknow how much clearer we can be about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Does okay mean --\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's \ngoing to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the \nadministration?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any \ncongressional investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the \nincidents that occurred yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully \nwith any congressional hearings that would be held?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  \nOne that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had \na bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children \nmay have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either \nleft them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  \nWhat do you know about those two --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts \nthis morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know \n-- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by \npeople who came out of the compound.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President received any report today in \nterms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've \nbeen able to find out on in the compound now?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that \nthey've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it \nto cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported \nin the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney \nGeneral Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from \nthe so-called experts?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands \nbehind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of \nher advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he \nsupports that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about the validity of the decisions made on \nthe ground?  Does he back those --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions \nmade.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the \ndecision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the \nPresident says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the \ndecision?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed \nabout the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility \nfor it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the \ndecision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated \nthe facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department \nand FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision \nand then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the \nchain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The \noperation went forward, and the President accepts full \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to \ngo back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that \ncame through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or \nwith his involvement?  What was his involvement?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice \nDepartment for the specific interaction between the Attorney General \nand the Director.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many \ndifferent ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by \nthe Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney \nGeneral in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, \nI want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who \nmade the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you \nknow, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The \nAttorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about \nthose decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to \nit, and he accepts full responsibility.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have, based on what you know here at the \nWhite House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during \nthis --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Along those same lines, just in your initial review \nof the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come \nfrom not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having \nan FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?    \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do \nwith it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went \nforward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet \nReno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to \nspeak to Clinton?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her \nresponsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I \nthink she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed \non the situation in Waco?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a \ndaily basis.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who briefed the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, \nwhat conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on \nthe events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a \nWhite House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House \nstaff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into \nexactly who briefs him on what subjects.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Another subject?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On another subject.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How close are you to signing the biodiversity \ntreaty?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech \non Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where \nyet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would \nyou characterize the speech tomorrow?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day \nspeech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past \npositions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much \ninto what he's going to talk about tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On or off campus?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this at a location outside the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We \ndon't know exactly where yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President \ntalked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll \ntry to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today \n-- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, \nthat the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration \nstill believe that it can work and that they will sign on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of \npeaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the \nadministration is considering a wide variety of options at this \npoint.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of \nEastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with \nhis Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that a question they're going to try to be \ndeciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of \noptions, including the peace plan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the group that he's meeting with today include \nReg Bartholomew?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be \namong the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General \nPowell.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent \nencounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating \nthe no-fly zone?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.  I'll get back to you on that.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will the President be meeting with every one of the \nleaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, \nwith Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with \nthe rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  As a group, or one by one?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and \nWalesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for \nquite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of \nstate that are here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he \nsupports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been \nworked out for him to address the march on Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some \nkind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact \ndetails of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Not a live phone hook-up?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting \nto Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to \nthe other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on \nit.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know what it's on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  \nWhen will he be meeting with the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll \ntalk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, \nbut exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So he's not going to come immediately to the White \nHouse?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Drug czar?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you expect it before the march?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the \nLloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on \namendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is \ncommitted to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  \nAnd we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where \nwe end up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When this briefing is over can you give us word \nthrough the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to \nJanet Reno?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's become a pressing question for the last \nseveral hours.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, \nand I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered \na compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the \nbest alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a \nsecond look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that \ntoday, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the \nMitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that \nwill be at the march on Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the \nPresident.  I don't know who yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, has it been decided how he's going to \naddress?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but \nthere hasn't been a final decision on that yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The official will read the letter, is that what it \nsounds like?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you \nknow what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come \nup, but it was about economic issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the \ntarget?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress \nspeech at the end of May --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the \nPresident will present the health care plan to the people.  I \nwouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.\n\n                                 END10:08 A.M. EDT\n\n"}

Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals\nfor MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this\nwith the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.\nFurther correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.\n\nLo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members\ndid not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of\nArab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts\nbetween Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties\nwhile others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.\n\nI worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this\nlast one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that\nwere returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system\nwas structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there\nwas no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.\n\n|> Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party\n|> has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition\n|> members do the same?

This is a power base that can not be ignored!\nEspecially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again\ndue to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party\nworks from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most\npolitical situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.\n\nAnd to answer your question, I \"broke\" with labor because I felt\nthat they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox\ncoalition members.\n\n|> >From \"The OTHER Front\", July 29, 1992.

Igor and I had thought that if it was \na girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, \nwe'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without\nIgor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.\n\nOur family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew \nup together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. \nIn 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in \nSumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,\nSeryozha, is four and a half.\n\nFirst I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from \nwork I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were \nKomsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were \nboth Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were \nshouting, \"There's no room for Christians here!\" and \"When we finish with the \nArmenians, we'll go after the Russians!\" And some even cried Out, \"Death to \nthe Armenians!\" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became \nfrightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen \ndowntown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich \nMelkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he \nreturned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was \nsmashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I \nwas telling him everything, too, and he said, \"What, is there no longer any\ngovernment?\" That same day Igor said, \"Papa, something terrible is happening \nin the city.\" And he said, \"We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our \nown home.\"\n\nThe day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called \nour relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the \nsame thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an \nArmenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I \ncalled the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and \nnonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.\n\nOn February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were \nafraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I \ntold the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't \nbe coming in. He agreed, and even said, \"Fine, don't come in, we understand \nwhat's going on in town, don't come in.\"\n\nBefore that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my \nfather-in-law and said, \"Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are \nhappening in town.\" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, \"With my own eyes I \nsaw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know,\" he said, \"we \nshould leave town.\" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we \nshould go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, \nclothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the \nbuilding manager came by and said, \"Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is \nbad, don't go out.\" My father even opened up to him and said, \"Maybe we'll \ndrive to the dacha, it'll be safer there.\" \"No,\" he said, \"it'll be worse \nthere, you'll be safer at home.\" He said don't be afraid, if something happens \nI'll send people to save you.\n\nAfter he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our \ncourtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two \nchildren, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my \nmother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of \nthem, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started\nbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, \"Go in that room\nand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear\nthat there's anyone home.\" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my \nbrother-in-law's wife, suggested, \"Let's run out onto the balcony.\" We -- the\ntwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out\nonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, \n\"Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all.\" We lived on the\nsecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At\nfirst we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time\npeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I \npleaded and begged: \"Please, call someone, have someone come!\" I even started \nshouting. \"I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them \nand take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive.\" Either they \nwere afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were \nwatching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it \nagain, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the \nbuilding and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A \nbus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing\nover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children \nover there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet \nseven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; \nyou know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, \nand Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and \ncrying. My Kristina said, \"Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're \nafraid!\" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina \ndidn't even want to climb over. She shouted, \"I'm staying with Grandmother,\nI'm staying with Grandma!\" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And \nmy mother-in-law shouted, \"Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there, \nsave Kristina, too!\" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira \nhelped us and went back inside.\n\nWe started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist, \nSevil, open the door, open it, please!\" She didn't open it. \"No, go away, go \nanywhere, go, I'm not opening the door.\" She was our neighbor, we were \nfriends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we \nwere going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and \nsaid, \"Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll \nkill us, too, because of you.\" I begged, \"Please, at least take the children, \nwe'll leave, we'll go back.\" \"No,\" she said, \"you have to leave.\" Her sons ran \nin, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: \"Get out \nof here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!\" I became terrified, I took the \nchildren and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down \nand heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard \"The Armenians must be \nkilled, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!\" One of \nthem said, \"Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!\" When I \nheard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their \ndoor for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any \nlonger. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, \nthat they would save her.\n\nMy head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next \nentryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a \nhalf. They were crying, \"Mamma, we're scared!\" They were so frightened that I \ndidn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was \nawful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, \"Open up, let \nme inside!\" He opened the door slightly and said, \"No!\" \"No\" and that was it! \nHe said it so sternly: \"No!\" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists \non the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood \nthere, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get \ndown on my knees. \"Please, I beg of you, at least take the children.\" He \nwasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me \ninside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't \npassed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want \nto open the door. And again I started pleading, \"Please, open the door, it's \nour Ira and Lilia! Open the door!\" And he said, \"No, I'm afraid.\" I said again \nand again, \"Please, open the door, please!\" He looked at me. He looked at me \nfor a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We \nthrew ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into \nthe bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, \"Calm \nthe children, and calm yourselves down, too.\"\n\nCalm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in \nour apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I \nsaid, \"Igor, Edik, let's say farewell.\" And Edik turned around and looked at \nme as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would \nkill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They \nstarted pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that \nhe had told us, \"Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight.\" He thought we \nwere in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: \n\"Edik, Igor, let's say farewell.\" Igor didn't think we could climb over to the \nother balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were \nable to save ourselves.\n\nIgor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All \nthe men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next \nto the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from \nthe other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: \"Open the door!\" We \nwere all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, \"They're home,\nthey're in there, break down the door!\" And I remember my father-in-law \nwhispering, \"They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . \"\n\nHe had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were \ngoing to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal \nchair legs. From outside the door they said, \"We're counting to five, open \nup!\" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was \nhome. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law \nhad said, \"It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? \nEveryone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with \neveryone.\" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani \nguest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there \noften, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save \nourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, \"I'm not \nleaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight \nalongside them.\" That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, \n\"If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight \nalongside my family, I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nWe were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and \nshouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor \nat the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's \nvoice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a \nlong time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: \"Open the \ndoor, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's \nher voice!\" But the Lezgin said, \"It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in \nyour apartment.\" He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and \nthe Lezgin opened the door and said, \"Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran \naway.\" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him \noutside, next to the building.\n\nWhile we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The \nway Ira shouted! She shouted, \"Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!\" \nShe repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many \npeople there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, \nwhistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.\n\nApparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway \nwhere we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I \ndon't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in\nparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed \nover the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law \nwere climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming \nup the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were \nour last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. \nThey were sleeping. I woke them up: \"Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!\" And I tell \nIra: \"Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony.\" We \nwere on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door \ntoo, because later he said, \"I opened the door and told them there were no \nArmenians inside.\" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the \nbalcony himself to see: they were gone.\n\nWe weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from \nthe building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider \nhiding us.\n\nThe Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, \n\"Karina, there're no lights on in our block.\" The whole block was dark, the \nwhole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, \"I'm afraid to keep\nyou until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving\nyou.\" I said, \"What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave\nwith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere\nelse to hide.\" He said, \"Well OK, go look.\" I asked Ira, \"Ira, do you want to\ngo?\" Ira said, \"No, I'll stay with the children, Karina.\" I said, \"Fine, then\nI'll go.\" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one \nwas in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at \nafter seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never \nwent out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a\nslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the \nboarding school and my director answered. He said, \"Karina, where are you?\" I\ndidn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I \nwas. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what \ntime it was, I asked him, \"What time is it?\" He said 11:20, I think, but I \ndon't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I \nlook and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there\nwas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse \nfor a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen \ngrabbed my hand and squeezed it: \"Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on, \nwhat are you turning around for?\" I turned around and saw a large truck, it \nmust have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck \nlike that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the \nfourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police \nthen they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the \npolice station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, \"Soldier, in \nBlock 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to \nsave them!\" And he said, \"Go to the police station and tell them everything.\" \nI said, \"I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them.\" He said, \"Don't be \nafraid.\"\n\nWe went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military \nvehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the \npolice station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that \nthey'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to\nthem.\n\nAfter a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us \nto the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they \ntook us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, \nvery many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was \nonly wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, \nnothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.\n\nThe Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably \nalive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of \nSumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came \nand told us, \"Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party \nCommittee.\" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for \nsix days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee \nand waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira \nhad only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went \nby. And then one of the functionaries told us, \"Karina, Ira, gather your \ncourage. Would you like to go to the burial?\" I said, \"What, did they really \nkill all of them?!\" He said, \"Let's look.\" He had a long list, and he started \nreading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-\nlaw, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,\nand Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, \n\"Get in the car, let's go to the burial.\"\n\nWe buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive\nof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my \nchildren when they're older?\n\nMy children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and\ngrandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and\ngrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, \"My grandma is \nbetter than anyone!\" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's \ndifficult for her, and once she told her: \"You're a bad grandmother.\"\n\nI don't know why, I asked her, \"Kristina, where's Papa?\" and she said, \"They \nkilled him.\" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded\nSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, \"When Papa \ncomes I'm going to tell him everything!\"\n\nJuly 26, 1988\nNairi Boarding House\nNear the Village of Arzakan\nHrazdan District\nArmenian SSR\n\t\t\t- - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

The original letters he wrote have\n>>long since decayed into dust.

Somehow I doubt do that yourself\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \n\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\ncarved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \n\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\nII.\n\n\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\n\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\n\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\n\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\n\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\n\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\n\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\n\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\n\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \nbattle.)\n\n\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\n\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\n\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\n\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\n\n\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\n\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\n\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\n\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\n\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\n\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\n\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\n\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\n\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\n\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\n\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\n\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\n\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\n\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\n\t...\n\tI call to you, my father Amun,\n\tI am among a host of strangers;\n\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\n\tI am alone, there's none with me!\n\t...\n\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\n\tAmun is more helpful than they;\n\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\n\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\n\n\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\n\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\n\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\n\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\n\tHe called from behind as if near by:\n\t\"Forward, I am with you,\n\tI your father, my hand is with you,\n\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\n\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\n\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\n\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\n\t...\n\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\n\tNot one looked behind him,\n\tNot one turned around,\n\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\n\t...\n\tOne called out to the other saying:\n\t\"No man is he who is among us,\n\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\n\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\n\tThey are of one who is unique,\n\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\n\tCome quick, flee before him,\n\tTo seek life and breathe air;\n\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\n\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\n\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\n\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\n\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\n\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\n\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\nwords: \n\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\n\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\ncompletely credible. \n\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\nmust be true:\n\n> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \n> Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\n> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\n> programmers, fiction?

Would that not be the most audacious\n> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\n> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?\n \nI have three points.  \n\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\nthe testimony of Hindus:\n\n\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \n\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \n\t hooey?\"\n\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\npleading?\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \n\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\ndeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've\npreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. \n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of \n     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become \n     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for \n     thinking I shall ever change them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tAbraham Lincoln\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Judge J S Wakefield \n\t\t\t\t\tafter the death of Willie Lincoln.\n"}

The\ntwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put\non trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and\nsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was\nthe first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to\nprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the\ndirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the\neffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case\nwere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.\n\nWhen they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators\nagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed\nin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the\ndirectors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter\nof the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,\nbut also \"the culture of lies\", which Judge Landau had described in\nhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. \nNothing had changed.\n\nThe report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among\nthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system\nand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not\nknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with\nlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the\nexplanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered\nfrom his very high position to a less high position.\n\n. . .\n\n[\"The culture of lies\" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators'\npolicy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were\ntortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought\nto correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --\nthus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those\nmethods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to\nlie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking\nto the \"approved\" torture methods. -- Yigal]\n--\nYigal Arens\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\narens@isi.edu\n"}

How's that for an answer?  :-)\nSeriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you are\ntalking about a governmental employer or not.  In this case, I\nbelieve that there should be absolutely no discrimination,\ndirect or indirect, period.  I feel this way not because it would\noffend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), but\nbecause the government is a coercive entity which we cannot\nescape.  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were\n\"whites only\" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountains\nfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains\ncertainly were not applied to \"whites only.\"  In essence, we\ncannot escape the coercive state.  Even Randy Weavers have to pay\nproperty tax.  On the other hand, private employers are not a\nmonopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not by\nthe government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over to\nthat government.\n\n#> Why?

In Santa Cruz\n(where a number of loony anti-discrimination laws exist),\na guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had\nevery imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe,\nand his tatoos were very distracting.\n\n#> Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA.

Neil Smith by Cathy Smith\n\n\n                         THE LIES OF TEXAS\n\nOkay, what have we learned?\n\nFor reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known \n-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative \ncommittees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard\nof the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and \npersonal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the \nFirst, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe Constitution. \n\nThe man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw \nagency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own \nlosses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his \nelectricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside \nworld. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in \npronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency \nfinds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit \neager to gain credit for \"straightening out the mess\" -- and, more \nimportantly, to script his side of the subsequent \"negotiations\" \nany way they please. \n\nThe impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time \nfour L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a \nsingle individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. \nArmored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers \nusing scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious \nrecords at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive \nthose in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority \nwill mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean \nCommunists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). \n\nFinally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising \nof the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house \nand gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and \nis reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, \nincluding those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. \n\nSpokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the \nPresident all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: \nblame the victim. \n\nHe had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a \nsecret government workshop and planted among the cinders being \n\"examined\" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children \n-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. \nHe set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in \n3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that \nJim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to \nembarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was \nsevered at the start of the whole travesty. \n\nA leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe \nthat a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow \nresponsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever \nknow 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound \nmore like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? \n\nVery well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never \nforget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and \nrightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, \nit was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which \nmay explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage \nand integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) \nabout the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a \nmouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. \n\nMore importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower \nof Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance \nas Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the \nsystem, then at least within yourself. \n\nOn March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of \nthe Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw \nagency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised \nin its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both \nagencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped \nto write that plank. \n\nTrue, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in \n1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone \nin a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their \nbehinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what \nhappened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, \nWaco never would have happened. \n\nThink about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough \nof political parties more interested in collecting and holding \npower -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human \nlife -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe \nthe change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less \ntiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.\n\nThink about it.\n\nL.

La Groupe des Cooper-\nantes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and if\nyou were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as\nthe well-lit one with double-turrets at the top.  As for Ontario,\nwhich still dominates and anchors business up north ...\n\nCanada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade\nAgreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment\nold money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one\nside, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and\nprofessionals on the other.  The final Trudeau administration and\nthe first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux\nriches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that\nmotivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's\ninitiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count\nof his caucus after the 1984 election).\n\n>It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives\n\nWell, you have to realize that in our society that's like saying\nthat \"it's not really national defence\" because you can't hire\nyour own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.\n(BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their\nportion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance\nalternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile\nto whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their\nfew redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;).\n\n>Also, in the April 14 Globe and Mail, there was a letter from the\n>director of trauma services at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto\n>responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in\n>California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that\n>American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada\n>rationed vital services.

He said that a system in which people are refused\n>treatment because they can't afford it is no different from a system\n>in which people are refused treatment because the government can't\n>afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health\n>insurance plan. In fairness, he did say that both the US and \n>Canadian systems are in the same situation.\n\nThe only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of\nhigh demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight\nfist on the licencing.  An obvious difference is that in such a\ntransient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling\nover Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed by\nrationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*\nsituation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the\nCalifornia health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing\namong the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is much\nless flexibility when dealing with our insured population than\nCalifornia (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a\nMUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources are\nfixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors\nmonopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either\ncase.  As for being \"refused treatment\" the government of the day\nwould be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;\nCanadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their\nhealth care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many\npeople have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized\nmedicine.\n\n>I know, I know, the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads\n>them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more\n>money from the government (another case of businessmen, once\n>scratched, becoming socialists).  \n\nRight, as I've pointed out above ...\n\n>But hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place\n>to the other? It hasn't really solved it.\n\nEither way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the\nchanges in the private medical care resource take place at a slower\nrate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of\ndisasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart\ndisease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship \nand specialty training.\n\n>People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their \n>insurance when they really don't need to.\n\nThat's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than\neducation, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are\narguing for (the leftists?  \"Ah, just let 'em spend!\" --- yeah,\nright!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions\nunder some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your private\ninsurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it all\nadds up in the OECD measures.\n\n>In fact, Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people\n>get Don Cherry jokes (:-).\n\nWe get the Sabres' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight (the\nDevils' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game).\n\n>(The NDP cleaning up a Tory spending mess?

Just take a look at a detailed atlas ...\nor better, take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto.\nMy first time across Lake Ontario to NYC, I was amazed by the\nincrease in density ... and the Toronto region is the densest \nin all of Canada.\n\n>There was one about a group of doctors in Calgary who have opened\n>Canada's first US-style MRI clinic, as an alternative to the\n>provincially owned one.\n\nIt's about time!  I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they\ndon't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's their\nmoney.  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, and\nthat's none of my business.  As for \"provincially owned\" ... for sure\nit's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved\nin the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-\nvations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by\non public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.\nMedical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My own\nbest friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,\nand is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.\n\n>There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of\n>two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act.\n\nNo, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have\nprivate practices ... and always have.  They can all take cash\nanyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadian\nbig government mentality often imagines government where it does\nnot even exist ...\n\nSince the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less\nlaidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians\ncan do the same.  As I've pointed out above, the law states that it is\nillegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for\nthe military and natives.\n\nLook, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...\nnobody stopped them when they bought it.  Nobody seems to be stopping\nthem from using it, either.  Much ado about nothing.  Thank goodness\nthat hockey playoffs have started ...\n\n>While it seemed currently unjustified, there was one anecdote told by\n>the head of the partnership to demonstrate the MRI.

I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened \nto American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.\nThere are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without\nrelying on MRI ... unfortunately, I've had a few. )-;  And I'm not\na banker.

The results were explosive\n   and damaging.\n\n   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting\n   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian\n   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout\n   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary\n   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>\n\n  page 188:\n\n  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,\n   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and\n   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking\n   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which\n   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries\n   earlier.\n\n   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth\n   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united\n   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth\n   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its\n   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When\n   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian\n   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre\n   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>\n\n  page 189:\n\n  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the\n  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from\n  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and\n  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through\n  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>\n\n  page 190 (second paragraph):\n\n  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population\n   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal\n   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews\n   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to\n   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>\n\n  page 190 (third paragraph):\n\n  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly\n   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist\n   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia\n   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by\n   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During\n   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred\n   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about\n   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were\n   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,\n   after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled\n   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac\n   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the\n   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the\n   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial\n   superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of\n   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of\n   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].\n   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled\n   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity\n   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into\n   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before\n   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression\n   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities\n   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years\n   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the\n   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the\n   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately\n   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary\n   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying\n   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of\n   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats\n   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman\n   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,\n   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the\n   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their\n   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th\n   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews\n   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu\n   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands\n   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and\n   Izmir [21].>>\n\n   page 193 (last paragraph):\n\n   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing\n   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe\n   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all\n   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being\n   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as\n   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and\n   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian\n   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,\n   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the\n   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally\n   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their\n   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors\n   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements\n   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done\n   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the\n   twentieth century.>>\n\n  page 194 (last paragraph):\n\n  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the\n   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the\n   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due\n   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of\n   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a\n   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of\n   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,\n   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms\n   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods\n   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from\n   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.\n\n   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian\n   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,\n   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,\n   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus\n   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically\n   described the situation caused by the invading armies:\n\n      'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,\n      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never\n      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the\n      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can\n      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the\n      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done\n      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government\n      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors\n      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The\n      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of\n      them were massacred in a single night....'[28]\n\n     'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and\n      burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high\n      civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of\n      6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by\n      flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and\n      without even anything to wear is in despair.

I realize it is \n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\n> are the other reasons?\n\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\nascribes this more broadly.\n\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\nthis way by a critical reader.\n\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\nit bit him on the keister twice.\n\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\nauthor's history of whatever.)\n\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\nthe text provide evidence?\n\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\nthan teach history.\n\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's \"Historian's Fallacies\"\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\nto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy\nto read.  Give it a try.\n\nRussell\n\n"}

We do them regardless.  \n\nKent Sandvik responds:\n\n> Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you \n> have to feel guilty . . . \n\nI think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't view\nguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   \n\n\"Feelings\" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of \nbeing guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\n\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \ndidn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word\n\"guilt\" as how a court uses it.\n\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\n\n> and then there's this single personality that will save you from this\n> universal guilt feeling.\n\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\n\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \ncategory to some extent in their lives.\n\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\nisn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \n\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\nis eternal.\n\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\nseparated the \"goats from the sheep\".   Many people in the\nlast day will ask him, \"Didn't I prophesy in your name and do\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?\"   And what did Jesus say?\n\"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.\"  That is the cornerstone of \nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \n\n> Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,\n> I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this\n> huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.\n\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \nin the common english venacular, \"feeling guilty\" has a\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\n\n> This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain\n> personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain\n> religious doctrines. And if your personality type is \n> opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain\n> world view system.\n\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.\n\n> There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice\n> thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,\n> the shoulders feel far more relaxed!\n\nYes.  You have stated what Jesus said.  Remember?  \"Come to me,\ntake my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light.\"  A yoke\nis used to direct oxen to do work.  Once you have a relationship with \nJesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.  Having \nGod at your side is of great advantage.\n"}

The Greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and\nthis great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library. The Christians \ngot a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems \ninvaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling \ninto Moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners, not the \nMoslems), or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it. \nEither way, a tremendous amount of information was lost.

Let's consider some \"personal interpretations\"\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\n\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\n\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\n\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\nexamining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\n\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\n\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\n\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\n\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'...\" (Articles of Faith,\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\n\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\n\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\n\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\n\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\nMcConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\n\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\n  Messianic prophecy?\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\n  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\n  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\n  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\n\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\n\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\nwhich reads:\n\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\n\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\n\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\n\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\n\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\nthe Father.\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\n  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\n  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\n  Messiah, p. 532)\n\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's \"arrest and\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\n\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\n\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\n\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\nwill be considered in this examination.\n\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\n\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in\nChrist's death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\n\n        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.\n        110:4.\n\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\n  says: \"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\n  p. 450)\n\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\n\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\n     (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\nhim [Christ]...\"\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\nverses.\n\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\nthese Scriptures:\n\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\n\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\n\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\n\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\nthe Messiah.\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\n\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\n\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\n\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\n\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. \"The\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\n\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\n\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\n\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\n\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\n\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\n\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\n\n        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\nScriptures prove this fact:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\n\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\n  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)\n  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,\n  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)\n\n  \"...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.\n  43:3)\n  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)\n\n  \"And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of\n  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\n\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\n  22:12)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1\n  Thess. 3:13)\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)\n  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)\n\n  \"...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...\n  (Ezek. 34:15-16)\n  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\n  (Luke 19:10)\n\n  \"For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy\n  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)\n  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great\n  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and\n  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;\n  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and\n  Rev. 3:19)\n\n        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" they\nare wrong when they say He is not \"Elohim.\" The Bible reveals that\n\"Jehovah\" is the only true \"Elohim\" there is; all others are false.\nRemember, \"Jehovah\" is the personal name of the triune God who has\nrevealed Himself in the Bible.\n\n        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that \"Jehovah\" and\n\"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note\nthat not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as \"Jehovah\"\nand \"Elohim\" but so is the Holy Spirit.\n\n  \"Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I\n  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my\n  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And\n  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" and \"said\" added)\n  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a\n  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...\n  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\n  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will\n  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.\n  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy\n  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" added)\n  \"The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in\n  my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\n\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\n\"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\n\n  \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\n  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\n\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah's\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\n5:27)\n\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\nBible reveals that \"Elohim's\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\n\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\n\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\n\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\nman's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\ntruth about who created man.\n\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\n  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)\n\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\n  made_....\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on \"souls...I\n  have made\" added)\n\n  \"Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\n  from the womb_.\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...\n  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...\n  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD\n  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.\n  4:32,35)\n\n  \"Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the\n  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the\n  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)\n\n  \"...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of\n  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon\n  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\n\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\n\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\n  all things that in them are.\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\n\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\n\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\n  Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: \"We will\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\n\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\n\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\n\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\n\n        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\n\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\n\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\n\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\n\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\n  developed....\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\n  Father, and to him only....\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\n\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\n\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\n\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\n\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\n\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\n\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\n\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\n\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\n\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\n\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\nidolatry.\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\n\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\n\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\n\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\n  (Josh. 23:7)\n\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\n\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\n\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\n\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\n\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\n  24:15-16)\n\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\nand all therein.\n\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\n\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim's\" covenant\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim's\" of\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\n\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\n\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\nworld to redeem mankind.\n\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\n\"Jehovah.\"\n\nSummary\n\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\n\n        In answer to Jesus' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\n\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\n\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\n1)\n\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\nThe Bible says:\n\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\n\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\n\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\n\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\n17:3)\n\n  \"...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you.\" (Ju. 2:3. See also\n  Exod. 23:32-33)\n\n\n\n"}

Ideally, these questions could be\nasked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \n\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\n     the BATF obtained?\n\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \n     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant \n     in a manner prescribed by law?\n\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\n     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \n\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\n     dispossessed weapons.\n\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\n\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\n     situation? \n\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\n\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\n\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \n     penetrated?\n\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\n\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\n\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\n     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is \n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\n\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \n     shots from high-power rifles?\n\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\n\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************\n"}

If the FBI had\nhad the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type\nraid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.\nIt really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity \nto give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead\nhe ordered the murder of the children.\n\n\nIn order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive\nthe words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the \nsuicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given\nthe BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met\nby gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter\nclaim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the \nAFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier\ngrade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes\nthey were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons.\n\n\nThe B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were\nquite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any\ntime. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have\nachieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of \nmagintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes\nand Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch \napocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties\nthan 80.\n\nAllowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious\nrisk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the \nquestion of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over\na prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared\nKoresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go\nin prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.\n\n\nCan you think of a better way of getting the children out?\n\nA 100% certain way?\n\n\nThe people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire\ngovernment story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for \nthem to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require\nthem to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come\nup with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to\nset out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them\nto get gun control legislation through.\n\nThis conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its\nagents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the\nmiddle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.\n\nStill the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that\nWACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in \nresolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a \ncomparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it\ncould be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it\nrests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular\nthe person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF\nagents and 17 children on his or her conscience.\n\n\nThere are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society\npreach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the\nvery people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO\nmay not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group\nof the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example\nand holding several hundred children hostage.\n\nThe only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent\nthem arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation. \nthis is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power\nweaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah\nto set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker\n"}

There are people who convert from\nnon-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I\ndon't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an\ninteresting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People are\nnaturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want\nto believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is\nnothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.\nReligion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things\nscience has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of\nsecurity... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.\nThat they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This\nhas a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these\npeople are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their\nbelief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of\nuseless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with\ntheir fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too\n(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept\nthe harsh reality that they are running from).\n\nAnyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theism\ndoesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow\nup as a theist (although this happens far too often).

While I am not\nfamiliar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi\nArabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the\npilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly in\nfavor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabia\nand Pakistan) and against \"Outlaw\" countries like iran and more\nrecently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive\ngovernments there but I think they get more slack than Israel\nfor things they do \"wrong\". Again the reason some condemnations\ndon't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The\ngassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and\nsince Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation\nresulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved\nanother case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no\none cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including\nin Israel and the occupied territories).\n\tAgain I appreciate the lack of personal insults.\n"}

Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church\n  leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach\n  was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the \n  BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole\n  theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces \n  of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds\n  played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound\n  with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them \n  they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was\n  evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up \n  a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they\n  broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving \n  relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'\n  childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender\n  seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.\n\n\n---peter\n\n\n\n"}

I think Arab \ncalls for Palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by Arab hands had \na greater effecton Arab migration than Deir Yassin.\n\nIn fact these jewish TERRORIST groups managed\n>all in all to scare off 300, 000 Arabs by may 15 1948.\n\nReally.  Nice use of caps.  I like it.  Very effective.  Actually, according to \nmany sources, including American diplomatic officials, the greatest encouragment\nfor Arabs to leave their villages came from Arab leaders.\n\n>This certainly might be all a matter of semantics however.  You\n>might say that the Hagana did this for war...  but like I said\n>before, how do we not know that the Palestinian conflict isn't\n>equatable with a war?

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is going \nto come out at 1:15 p.m.  With your indulgence, I think what we'd \nlike to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award \nfirst and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll \nmake a statement on Waco and take a couple questions.  So if we can \njust hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably \nwill work out a lot better. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If you'll give us the time.  That's the problem.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've got a two-minute warning problem.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.  It's about \n1:15 p.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The teacher would walk off and then --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's -- I'm just trying \nto work this out here.  I think that's the best way to handle it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way \nthe President handled the notifications yesterday? \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice \nDepartment about who would come out and discuss what had happened in \nWaco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even \nfarther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on \nthe contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As \nyou know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion, \nabout 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of \nwhat she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had \nthe implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised \nno objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general \nnature about the incident.\n\t     \n\t     Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the \nPresident spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief \ndiscussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was \nbefore the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why \nthere was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was \nconfusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day \nwhen they spoke.  \n\t     \n\t     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of \ndifferent levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the \nJustice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of \n\f\ntheir decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI \nbriefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.  \nThe President then issued a statement after that.\n\t     \n\t     Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair \namount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in \nWaco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the \nPresident say anything until we had a much better sense of what was \nactually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what \nwas happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a \nstatement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday \nevening.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At what hour was that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it \nwas after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of \nthe Holocaust Museum last night.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he went out to dinner.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to \ndinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I \ndon't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he \njust said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to \ntell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, \nthat she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try \nand get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning \nabout the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this \nafternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to \nmake at 1:15.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last \nnight, or this morning?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White \nHouse Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney \nGeneral was running the operation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that \nshe had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get \nsome sleep?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good \njob -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I mean, sleep well has implications as to \nconscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody \nfeels badly when you have a situation when --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame \nis brought up in that phraseology.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it \nhas nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered \nwas that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General \nhad to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation \nyesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best \nas she could and --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, does he think it was mishandled?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm \nwords to a friend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he think the situation was mishandled?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In retrospect?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the \nAttorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time, \nI think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what \nexactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can \nto make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen \nagain, or at least we know how to handle it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How much did he know about what she was going to go \nahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --\noutlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely \nwhat action?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific \noperational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they \nhad a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of \naction.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just \ntrying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't \nminute-by-minute detail of how the operation --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, was it, \"we are going in.\"  Is it, \"we're \ngoing to use tear gas\"?  I mean, what?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go \nin and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in \nthe compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement \nout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was there ever a conscious political \ndecision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President \nfrom --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in \nclose contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts \nresponsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted \nto be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as \nwe could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility \nof those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General \nhas operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts \nresponsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney \nGeneral.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, there was a report on the television today \n-- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult \nhad said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire \nand not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of \na smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my \nquestion is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that \nthis fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound \n-- every bit of evidence we have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do \nthis now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible \nconsequences of either death or injury?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific \nquestions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going \nabout being made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Those are general questions and did he ask \ngenerally, why now?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you \nconsidered all of the consequences; have you considered the \nrecommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, \"why now?  \"  \nI don't know if he asked that specific question.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff \nthat's come out since then about the information provided by the \nlistening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much \nspecific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that \nthis is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the \ndecision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations \nshe was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of \nthose involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was \nbeyond that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the President's understanding why \nyesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple \nweeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may \nhave told law enforcement people something that precipitated this \naction.  Why yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I \nthink what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has \nsaid.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at \nsome danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and \nit was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that \nthe situation was not going to get any better at all.  \n\t     \n\t     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of \nthe agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that \nthese teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has \nsaid, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have \nreplacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a \nconcern over the safety.  \n\t     \n\t     All of these factors came into play.  They also \nconsidered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts \non David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to \nwhat the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best \njudgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They \ndid.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly \nunfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out \ndifferently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were \nmade at the time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, when did the President know that they were \ngoing to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe \nhe was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.  \nI just don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Along that point, George, can you say whether the \nplan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way \nto end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way \nto increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, \nas a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't \npresented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this \nrelevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet \nReno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that \nthey were acting on the best advice and the best information they \nhad, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was there a 12-hour gap between \nconversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In \nother words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again \nuntil Clinton got back from dinner at --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was \nthere a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner \nwhen she called and --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her \nlast night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last \nnight.  He just wanted to talk to her.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     what was going on?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone \nhas perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the \nother details?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than \nthe FBI reported in Waco.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what \nis going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was \nhe keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due \nrespect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said, \nseveral people in the White House were in constant contact with their \ncounterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack \nMcLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?  \nThat's not a --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with \nWebb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I \nbelieve Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.  \nEither Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during \nthe day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed \nand fully informed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We were told this morning that the President may \nhave spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you \nknow if that's true or not?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may \nhave.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance \nthat he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think \nthat the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with \n\f\nthe Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the \nAttorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a \nminute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was \nhappening at the Justice Department.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, who decided that the briefing would be done \nby the Attorney General?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you or did the White House communications staff \n-- were you ever involved with that decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-\nLehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     there was no advice from the White House at all \nabout her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction \nto the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally \nthe White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not \nhaving him appear as personally saying anything?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at \nall.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of \nthe information at hand.  The President is also making a statement \ntoday.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The \nPresident has been fully involved --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After this turned into less than a successful \noperation, the only statement from the President was what was on \npaper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to \nthe major facts in this.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement \nfrom the President, not the only statement from the President, number \none.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After the --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.  \nNumber two, the Attorney General --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He gave a statement early in the morning when the \nthing was starting to move --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday \nand he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It just happens this was a written statement with \nno sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was \nthe President wants to put out a written statement?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time, \nwe thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was \nappropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and \nexpressing his support for the Attorney General's --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do \nsomething?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.  \nThat is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't \nsay the President took full responsibility for what happened --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, what you said was --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I \nmean, unless I miss something --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     Janet Reno said that she took full \nresponsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes \nresponsibility.  Absolutely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Took responsibility -- all right.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Considering how little was known about what was \ngoing on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why \nis Washington calling this a mass suicide?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we \nknow now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and \nduring, it is painfully clear that those there were under his \ncontrol.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are \nconcerned, though, isn't it, George?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely \ndifferent matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear \nresponsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he \nclearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, \nand that's what he did.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're still operating completely on assumption, \nright?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that \nthis was mass suicide.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside \nthe compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of \nthose inside.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's \nquestion, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton \nhimself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff \non this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Right after the evening news went on the air?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the \ninformation.  We were working on it.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q \t  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the \ninvestigation the President is going to announce is going to be an \nadministration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the \noutside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a \npolitical stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have \nalready been --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and \nthe Justice Department will bear responsibility for the \ninvestigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations \nlike this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But \nit will be run by the Treasury and Justice. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you confident that you will not have any \nproblem getting --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, did the President reach out to anybody else \nto get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the \nWhite House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was \nthere at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a \nmeeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sunday.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it \nwasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but \nbeyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, you said that in that phone call, she said \nthat we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force \nhim out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know \nabout tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action \nto increase the pressure on --\n\t     \n\t     q\bQ\t   It didn't matter how she did that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What information did he have in terms of how this \nwould proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-\nby-minute, but in a general sense --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the \nrecommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the \nlaw enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is \"this\" -- when you say that \"this\" was the \nrecommendation --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I \ndon't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be \ntold that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a \nhole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they \nwere moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I \njust don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best \nadvice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general \nquestions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same \ntime -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous \nrecommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, it would seem that this question about just \nexactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of \nthe operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you \ntake that question and --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     get the answer and come back to us with all of \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a \nstrategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a \nwritten statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be \non all of these television broadcasts?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And you never called the Justice Department and \nsaid to anyone or Janet Reno, \"you're the one who needs to be out \nfront explaining this\"?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It just happened that way that she was the \nspokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney \nGeneral that it was important for her as the operational officer in \ncharge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the \nquestions on this tragic incident.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She had no guidance from the White House at all?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you \ndidn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     a strategy?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she clear it?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she notify you?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What happened to this great detailed process you \nhave for clearing and talking to every public information officer and \nevery -- under every rock and every place in government that \nsomething as major as this could have occurred without a discussion \nbetween you and the public information people at least at the Justice \nDepartment?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the \ndecision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed \nlike a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how \nyou would handle it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You wouldn't change a thing if --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The way the White House handled any part of it -- \nfrom start to finish.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad \nquestion and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the \nreasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that \nsomething like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like \nthis and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're \ntalking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, \nthere -- wouldn't make any change at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV, \nno White House people or outside media consultants came up with this \nidea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the \ncampaign.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline \nafter the draft story; watching Clinton on --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.  \nYesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended \nin tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was \ninvolved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to \ndo that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of \npublic information to go out and take the questions of the press in \norder to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she \ndid a fantastic job.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows \nClinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard \nto believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about \nwhat she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm \ngoing to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's \nfairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that \nhe did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a \nminute-by-minute account of the conversation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long a conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Telephone conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever \na consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, you keep saying that the President takes \nfull responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does \nthe President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is \nultimately his decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do \nwith Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a \nmilitary action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his \ngovernment.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as \nhers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her \ndecision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full \nresponsibility. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, this briefing has gone on just a little \nover 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.  \nWhat exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just \nvery general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone \nconversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think \nBrit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One of the things Reno said last night is that the \nbuck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the \nPresident agree with that in this case?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full \nresponsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that \nshe made a decision, that she's going to accept all the \nresponsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that \nat all, but neither is the President. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At any point in the conversation last night between \nthe President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever \noffer her a resignation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were \nsome Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is \nthe White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests \ntrying to make political hay out of this situation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any \nquestions about the motives of those who are requesting \ninvestigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and \ncomplete investigation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?  \nWill you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How \nwill you answer the question that you've taken?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you remind us what the President was \ndoing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was \ninvolved in?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He \nhad a series of meetings with different members of the staff during \n\f\nthe afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and \ngetting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as \nwell.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as \nwell.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And those reports would have come to him from Mack \nMcLarty, would they -- do you think?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to \nhim, I talked to him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, to follow Helen's question, in their \nconversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last \nnight in response to the question about whether she would resign?  \nDid he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here \nto reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at \nall?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up \nthat specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was \ndiscussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   The didn't talk at all about her kind of \nremarkable comment last night about --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a \nquestion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And her response was, if the President wants me to, \nI will.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the \nstandard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's \na conditional statement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     have a need to talk about whether -- personally \nabout whether the President wanted her --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about \nit.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was \nlargely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come \nup.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you take that with the Brit package?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, for the record, does the President want her \nto resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet \nReno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She \nhandled a difficult situation extremely well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, does the President feel that he and Janet \nReno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law \nenforcement experts on the ground?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not \nsecond-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.  \nThat is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.  \nEverybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best \njudgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best \ninformation we had.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on \nSunday, is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday \nmorning?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that \nquestion, too.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Were these outside experts that they were \nconsulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just \nnot sure.  I know that there were several experts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And also, why weren't there replacements for these \npeople?  Is the unit that small?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small \nhighly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things \nthat the investigation will examine.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI \nDirector?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, \ndoesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.  \nBut presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout \nthis entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone \nand talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from \nhim on what to do and what not to do?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI \nDirector well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke \nout in Waco.  At the same time, the Attorney General bears the \nultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the \nAttorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that \nDirector Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is \nbriefed and on the way that all of this evolved?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, it's perfectly \nappropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the \nAttorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and \nthat's following the chain of command.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you .\n\n                                 END                    1:03 P.M. EDT\n\t     \n#60-04/20\n\t     \n\n"}

However,\n\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\n\n   The Mode of Removal\n   -------------------\n\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\n\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\n\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\n   and city quarters.\n\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\ntheir action as follows:\n\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\n   torture you.\"\n\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\n\n\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\n>>relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \n>>anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\n>>\n>>To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\n>>they are not separate peoples.  ....\n>\n>\tHow touching.

However \n>\tone of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.\n\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \n\n>\tI should add few more things.  A.J. Evans, in his \"On Foot Through\n>\tB&H\" describes that Catholic clergy in the last century was \n>\tapparently more scared by Serbs, then by Turks, because Serbs were\n>\tgrowing stronger and, unlike Turks, represented great danger for\n>\tidea of Catholic Bosnia.  President Tudjman clearly states in \n>\this book that Muslims do not exist as a separate nation from \n>\tCroats and Serbs, and he many times suggested, even in interviewes to\n>\tforeign papers, that solution is to split Bosnia.\n> \n>\tJosip knows this and he is only working on the image of Croatia.\n\nIn international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to\ncounterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the\nend of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\nunstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \n\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\nIf not, then all bets are off.\n\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt.\nThis is not about some \"image\" but about survival of a concept of a\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\nand Muslims.  \n\nSigh...\nJosip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were\nsomehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are \"guilty\" of their\nlifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died\nfor me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an\nimpersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well\nenough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.\n\nI was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good\nthing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message\nof Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with\nChristianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I\ncan't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you\ndescribe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.\n\n>I know how that goes.

I will not steal, and I will not murder --\nnot because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't*\nin my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just\nrunning around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able,\ninsulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to\nanyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like\nthat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.\n\n>'Till I met the Man, that is.\n\nMy initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching\nand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of\nGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once \"felt\" this presence\njust as I had \"felt\" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a\nlittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I\nhad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as\nsomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.\n\nSince then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your\nsupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in\nmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for\na moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to\nknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I\nhave not yet received an answer.\n\n>= Only when I truly listened to myself, body and soul, did I realize\n>= that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being\n>= Christian.  There is a higher truth in the universe, and Christianity\n>= just ain't it.\n>\n>Any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be, and why?\n\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\non this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-\ndimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck\nin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables\nbecome too much for us to even speculate on.\n\nThat is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to\nbe, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor\nhad anything to do with it.\n\n>\"OK,\" you may say. \"So now, if I'm just being good, am I doing good enough?\"\n>\n>That's for you to answer.

All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,\nbut it's not going to be easy.\n\n>So much as you don't like what we're \"selling\", there just may be someone\n>out there that can identify with it.

It\npreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's\ngot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly\nintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say\nthat your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge\nChristianity from the Christians I know.\n\nI feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's\nself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason\nthan that.\n\nSo I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some\npeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly\nvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity\nwhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to\nrealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,\nfulfilled life.\n\nI have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice\nthings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses\nis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and\nthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to\nbelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think\nany less of people who don't agree with them.\n\n>Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the\n>Christian's faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we\n>propose otherwise.\n\nPrecisely my point.

That is, ignorance of the Bible\nand the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its \ncontents.\n\n> I regard Christ as a myth. \n\nBecause you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.\nAnd to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not\neven know what the word \"Christ\" means.  Or which prophet used \"Christ\" to \ndescribe the \"Son of Man\". \n\n> I feel that there are far too many people\n> offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and\n> did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.\n\nYes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come\nup with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said\nand by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else's\ninterpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the\ntruth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as \nmuch as a coffee cup needs interpretation.\n\nAnd remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  \nIt doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The \nBible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed \nto people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it \ntheir open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they\nwant you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to\nknow.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple\nstraight-forward language.\n\n> I choose the\n> roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of\n> any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn\n> back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.\n\nYou have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the\nroad that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that\nroad doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One\nthat goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,\nyou will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. \n\n>And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your\n>eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off\n>empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.\n\nI see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your\nlife.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing \nnew in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are \"spouting off\" \ncontradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must\nbe sad.\n\n> I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to\n> definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to\n> you so you can ask her, face-to-face.\n> You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask? \n\nBingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son\nso that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look\nwhat God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have \nhope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has\nglorious purpose.\n\n> You can't even convince me that it exists! \n\nBecause you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to\nlie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for \nthousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of \nJesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a \nbleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:\n\n      \"For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,\n       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead.\"\n\n> If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold\n> pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my\n> rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can\n> *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful\n> it is.\n\nArrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific\ncases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect\nin heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does\nnot expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not\nas his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his\nglorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  \nYou maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for\nyourself.\n\n>>Why would you want to live a good life?\n>>To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have\n>>no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the\n>>end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because\n>>everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading\n>>a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\n\n>That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word\n>I've said.\n\nI do understand what you said.   But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.\n\nYou missed the point.  Living a \"good life\" has no eternal consequences.\nOnce they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it \nis over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. \nIt has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. \n\nBut then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things \nis bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is\nall meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone\nyou dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?\nLife after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.\n\n> In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the\n> amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D\n\nAt which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.\n\n>>I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god\n>>I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in\n>>which case it's not really all that important.\n>\n>Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.\n\nSo you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa\nClaus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to\nbelieve that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I\ncan't similarly apply to Santa Claus.\n\nYou have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses\nof Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and \"ignore\" the\nreasons.  By definition, \"ignorance\". \n\nSanta Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves\nand flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human\nhistory seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose \nblinks red?    \n\nOn the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really\na king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon\nreally kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?\nDid Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did\nSennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a \nCaiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies\nit.  It is NONFICTION.\n\nDo you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you\ncan't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from\nthat of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal\ntruthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or\nis it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out\nthat it's not a fairy tale?\n\n>Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a\n>collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without\n>invoking them?\n\nGet real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?  Do you have to go there\nto be  assured that there really is such a place?  Given your \nirrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life.\n\n> Why do you believe what you believe?\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living\nGod, I'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didn't follow Jesus.\n"}

The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\n\nRemember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cos\nRochester does and they're also a company town.\n\n>But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said\n>Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs, which require\n>spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches.

Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the\nNazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be\nincluded.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.\nArmenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours \nred-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'\n\n[1] Joachim Hoffmann, 'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943, Turkotataren, \n    Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer,' (Verlag Rombach\n    Freiburg 1976), p. 172.\n\nWhile having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the\nSecond World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's\ndefeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces,\nhoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim \npopulation would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national\nsentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America\nfor his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish\ngovernment led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.\n\n[1] Walter Kolarz, 'Religion in the Soviet Union,' (London, Macmillan &\n    Co Ltd; New York, St Martin's Press 1961), pp. 160-164.\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

The story WAS \n>NOT filed frim Agdam but from London. \n\nI'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits.\n\nSource: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\n\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\n\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\" That's when\nthe real  slaughter began,\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. \"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\"\n    \" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\nkilling one person.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE\n\nThe stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:\n\n69 year old Hatin Nine telling:\n\n-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\n\"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of \"human rights?\"\nWhere are you?\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

It is to those\nwho read with open mind, that I address myself.\n\n%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\n%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the\n%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member\n%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial\n%discrimination as \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or\n%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic\n%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing\n%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of\n%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,\n%social, cultural or any other field of public life.\"\n\nWhile the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,\nas the text currently stands I know of no country in which\nracial discrimination of some sort can not be found.\nIt makes no mention of the need for for a legislative\nviolation.\n\n%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining\n%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The\n%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since\n%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli\n%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of\n%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United\n%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial\n%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.\n\nIf you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative\nstatements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be\napplied to any other case where the council perceives some form\nof racial discrimination as previously exhibited.\n\nScarey thought.\n\n%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of\n%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native\n%non-Jews born in that country. \n\nActually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not\nalienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be\ncorrect, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes\napparent.  This slant permeates the text.\n\n%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas\n%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most\n%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the\n%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.\n\nThe above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting\nBeduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.\nYour own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the\nissue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].\n\n%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim\n%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant\n%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).\n\nIf I recall correctly, at the time \"zionism\" took off, there\nwas no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any\nfactual contradictory evidence .\n\n%But the\n%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and\n%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the\n%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native\n%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and\n%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could\n%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000\n%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.\n\nDo you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on \"most\nof their villages\"?\n\n%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to\n%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their\n%political repression and their destitution.\n\nThere is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later\nused for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the\nintention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was\nthat this was not the case.\n\nYou also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded\nthis.  As you do again, below.\n\n%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied\n%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus\n%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its\n%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered\n%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security\n%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and\n%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these\n%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.\n\nNot quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,\nthough it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.\nIsrael never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other\nannexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.\n\n%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,\n%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of\n%international law and UN resolutions.\n\nOut of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,\nwhat int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories\ncaptured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country\npreviously (other than Iraq) ?\n\n%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under\n%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as\n%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a\n%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).\n\nIncorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against\non an \"ethnic or racial\" basis.  Therefore your above statement is\nincorrect.\n\nI also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,\nthe only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.\nHowever, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist\nat the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not\nargue racial discrimination during that period!\n\n%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a\n%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that\n%represents them in world affairs.\n\nOnce again, some do, some don't.\n\n%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab\n%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant\n%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.\n\nAnother generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care\nabout anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you\nespouse.\n\n%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the\n%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject\n%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be\n%challenged in court.\n\nIncorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.\nFurthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all\nof the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some\nare, but this is not due to the \"whims\" of the military as\nmuch as the sizeof the task/organization.\n\n%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied\n%territories are permitted to carry firearms.\n\nIncorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in\nDaheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of\nthe intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.\n\n%Jewish settlers have\n%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents\n%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel\n%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in\n%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will\n%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates\n%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish\n%settlement.\n\nThat is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your\npurpose is/was in posting this.\n\n%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them\n%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For\n%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected\n%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by\n%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish\n%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and\n%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to\n%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in\n%practice.\n\nOnce again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,\nright?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way\nyou seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but\nas a result of what actions?\n\n%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the\n%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are\n%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on\n%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these\n%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied\n%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in\n%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews\n%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government\n%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of\n%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;\n%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their\n%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and\n%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian\n%children are denied the right to learn their history and\n%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end\n%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the\n%authorities.\n\n1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.\n    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no\n    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish\n    collective.\n\n2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind\n    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has\n    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large\n    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case \n    in point.\n\n3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation\n    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously\n    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.\n    It is based upon Jordan's school system.\n\n4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another\n    gross generalization.  \n\n%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of\n%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never\n%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the\n%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its\n%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards\n%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is\n%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs\n%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately\n%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen\n%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of \n%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme\n%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in\n%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the\n%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.\n\nAnother generalization, but lets not stop here.\nThe transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,\nMoledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the\nterritories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,\nI recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered\npreviously.\n\n%Although sexual\n%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,\n%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal\n%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system\n%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.\n\nWhen was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,\nnor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious\nintervention is best answered by the proportional representation and\nthe lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.\n\n%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on\n%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has\n%not produced any written Constitution. \n\nSimply incorrect.\nThe answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the\ndynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your\ncontentions to the sidelines.\n\n%Zionism predicates a state\n%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,\n%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak\n%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli\n%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be\n%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial\n%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only\n%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the\n%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nBut the discrimination is not based upon race.\nOops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.\n\n%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that\n%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -\n%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed\n%to fail.\n\nReal world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.\nOf course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as\nyou are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate\nshall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the\namount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.\n\n\n\n-- \nShai Guday              | Stealth bombers,\nOS Software Engineer    |\nThinking Machines Corp. |\tthe winged ninja of the skies.\nCambridge, MA           |\n"}

The genocide involved not only the killing of \ninnocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. \nThey were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman \nArmy was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide \nas acting with a \n\n  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians.

The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy\nwas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian \nterritories.\n\nThe Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and\ntheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.\nThe massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and\nperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment.\n\nThe principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were\nDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,\nKarakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.\n\nSource: \"Bristol Papers\", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol\n         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.\n\n\"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in \n the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly \n defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder\n the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village.\"\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

This was even during the 9 month period when he was being\nwatched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned\naccording to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting\nthem, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted\nto have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...\n\nHe was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered\npeacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully).\nHe has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.\n\nThe justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased\n$200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).\nLast I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an\nINDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door\nshoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I\nknow of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you?\nI sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated\nlike the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it\nis a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the\nBATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt\npeople having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved\nreligeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF these\ndays?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT...\n\nMY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation,\nand NOW.

I am inclined to think a further wait\nwould have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergency\ngear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water\nwhen a fire was observed, instead of saying \"aw, gee, there is no water\".\n\nWhy so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building\nhad pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision\nthe firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't\nthe Feds TURN IT BACK ON?

It is a nice PR gimmick, though.\n\nI am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation\nfor possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI.\nI expect to hear \"they are our best law enforcement.

They speak Serbo-Croatian. But\nthere is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian\nand anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by\nchanging religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric\nwho brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls\n\"the people\" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals\ncall all the Bosnian Muslims \"Turks\" even though they are not ethnically\nTurk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,\nwhat is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically\nidentical but religiously \"other\" is called, paradoxically, \"ethnic\ncleansing\" rather than \"religious cleansing.\"\n\nThus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of\nWWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from\nBosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike.\n>\n--\nMichael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford College\nHaverford, Pa 19041-1392\n"}

McManus, National President of the John Birch Society\n>\n\n\nWhen McManus says, \"We have the world's best medical care,\" I can hardly\nbelieve he's referring to a system:\n\n1.  That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn't a\n    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than\n    10 percent.\n\n2.  That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all\n    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone.\n\n3.  Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life\n    expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many\n    preventable diseases.\n\n4.  We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs.  (To put that in\n    perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.)\n\n5.  The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on\n    health benefits.  Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere\n    else.\n\n\nHow can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world?  The only\nthing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients\nwith a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  And\nthe \"private\" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient\nthat it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every\nother sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.\n\nOf the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health\ncare costs last year, the Consumer's Union estimated that at least 200 billion\nwas thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and\nprocedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.\n\nThere are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.  But did the\n\"private competition\" stimulate more efficient paperwork?  Ask any doctor\nwho's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all!\n\nThe competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down.  The\ncompetition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the\nhospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment.  Spending millions on\nexpensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle\nisn't my idea of the world's best health care system.\n\nCompetition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and\nexpensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful.  I'm especially\nthinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and\nCesarean section.  Sound like the world's best health care system?\n\n\n\nEver notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in\nhealth care, the Libbies start bashing Canada's system?  First of all, Hillary\nClinton is not advocating another Canadian system.  I think that's been made\nabundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months.  Where did John F.\nMcManus get that idea, anyway?\n\nLet's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border.  Your\nchild needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals.  The\nnearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's an\nAmerican city one hour south.  Which way are you going to go?  Is it because\nthe American system is the \"best\" in the world, or just for convenience?\n\nIt still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and\nwhite on health care reform.  There are a million different ways we ould\nrestructure the system.  It's not just a choice between total government\ncontrol and total private control.  I wish the people screaming \"socialized\nmedicine\" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM\nTHEMSELVES on health care issues.\n\n\n\nThe current system sucks.  I want to keep providers private but that doesn't\nchange the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we\ndon't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  Purely private health care without any\ngovernment intervention doesn't work.  Hillary Clinton is not thinking of\nnationalizing providers or evern insurers.  How can you scream \"socialized\nmedicine\" at her programs?  Don't you even know what you're talking about?\n\n\n\nEver see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the\ndecade?  Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing?  Why?  I'll give\nyou one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we\ndon't do something about it.\n\n\n\nPEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.  The current health care system is a cancer which is\nkilling our economic well-being.  Costs are still rising 10 percent a year\neven as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into\nmanaged-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you\nask me.\n\nA couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please\ncome forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would set\nabout keeping costs down.  I didn't get a single answer.\n\nThe only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases\nfilled with evasive platitudes like \"give health care back to the people.\"\nJust do you expect to do that without serious reforms?  What is it about the\ncurrent system that you would change and how would that help?\n\n\nHow can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults?\nHow can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our\ninfrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwing\naway money which could be used to SOLVE those problems?\n\n\nAmerica needs health care reform NOW.

In exile,\nthey practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in\nCroatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership\nof Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world\nwar, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in \nto run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and\nBosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats\n(\"flowers of Croatian people\").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina\ntherefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they\njoined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at \nless than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.\n\nAfter WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended\nfrom Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,\nit was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as\neither Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current\npresident of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to\nprevent the category \"Muslim\" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the\nnext census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, since\nthat time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although\nsome still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat\nnationality.\n\nSincerely,\nJosip\n\n\n"}

You believe\nthat the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should\nconsider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which\nI believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute.\n_Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party,\nBoomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by\nanother party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported\nBoomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his\nproperty, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop\ndoing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider\nsuch issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to\ndo or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage\nfaced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case\nbefore the court.\n\n> Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation\n> requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because\n> of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1,\n> you'd be up in arms.

Quite the contrary, I'd\nprobably support the action, since it would be based on the same general\ndoctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in\n_Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated\nfor reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's\nproperty rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the\nhypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's\ncollective property rights in a healthy physical environment.

Which \"one\" are you\nspeaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights.\nBesides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never\nland of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people\nare going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise \"irrational\"\nfrom a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to\nprotect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logically\nthat your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,\nso I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150\nper head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't\nwant any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\n>> And then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\n>> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were\n>> avoided.\"  As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were\n>> \"made whole.\"  They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their\n>> rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that\n>> property at a price acceptable to them.

We don't\n> require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation;\n> why in tort?\n\nLast question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because\nto do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth\nAmendment.\n\nAs to your \"Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made\nwhole, because the award of damages in involuntary\" claim, you're at\nleast partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\nprefer).  In these cases, the \"sale\" has already taken place and is\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\n\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\npotential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\nparties themselves.\n\n>> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\n>> business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n>> (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\n>> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n>\n> Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.\n\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business.  The\nfact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into\na position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a\nresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant\nwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose\nproperty rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant.\nThere's nothing punitive or unjust about it.\n\n>> (2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\n>> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\n>> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\n>> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\n>> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\n>> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n>> [wdstarr]\n>\n> Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire\n> set of possessions to wronged person?

In addition to the\nchange in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages\n(eliminating many extraneous \"that's\" and \"of's\"), and many (minor) errors\nhave been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story,\ntestimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a \"Words-to-Know\"\nglossary.\n\nAs with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a\nnot-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome\nto make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the\nactual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge\nanything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit\nfrom the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself\nfor the precise terms.\n\nNegotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the\nprinting and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound\n\"first editions.\") I will make another announcement about the availability\nof printed copies once everything has been worked out.\n\nFTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then \"cd\npub\" (you won't see anything at all until you do).\n\n\"The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon\" is currently available in postscript and\nRTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made\navailable; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to\nprint the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple\nLaserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in\nthe last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work\nbetter.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in\nby a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the\nMacintosh and Windows. If you don't have a postscript printer, you may be\nable to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.\n\n-r--r--r--  1 dba                   1984742 Apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps\n-r--r--r--  1 dba                   1209071 Apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf\n\nFor more information about how this project came about, please refer to my\narticle in the current issue of _Sunstone_, entitled \"Delighting in\nPlainness: Issues Surrounding a Simple Modern English Book of Mormon.\"\n\nSend all inquiries and comments to:\n\n    Lynn Matthews Anderson\n    5806 Hampton Street\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15206\n\n    dba+lynn@cs.cmu.edu\n\n"}

Maybe they KNEW\nthat the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are\ntrying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing\non the Crips and Bloods.

He left his third-floor bedroom and began\nlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and \nchecking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    \ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings.

On\nthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal\nguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.\nBut, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons\nhasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke\nany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this\nis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.\nThe ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol\nviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should\nstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of\ntheir jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.\n\n> The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to\n> attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had\n> had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type\n> raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.\n\nSounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults\nalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are \"heavily-armed\nreligious wackos\".\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out\npeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON\nTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause\nthis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE\nLIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.\n\n> It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity \n> to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead\n> he ordered the murder of the children.\n \nDon't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the\ncult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that\nit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on\nfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions\nof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.\nTherefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED\nEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still\ndon't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the\nWaco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.\n\n> In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive\n> the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the \n> suicide/murder of his other 80 followers.

They\nhad MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic\npistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later\nretracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.\n\n> The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely.

If the sick little monkeys in\nWashington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then\nthey will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns\nme much more than new gun control legislation is that the government\nseems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are\nbecoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.

Wright\n\n(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct\n    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.\n\nOnly about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most\nrecent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a\nlicensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --\nobtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving\nfriends and associates, family members, and various black market\noutlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources\nincluded cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and\noften theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated\nby informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nINDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91\nIndependence Institute\n14142 Denver West Parkway #101\nGolden, CO 80401 \n(303) 279-6536\n\n              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY\n                             By David B. Kopel\n\n     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.\nThe study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous\ncriminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable\nimpact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns\nare purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.\n\n51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal\nEnforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of\n20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;\nof those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who\ncommitted crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)\n(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony\nconvictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\nFirearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to\nDirector, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony\nrecords who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or\nnon-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nINDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91\n\n                          THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC:\n                      POLITICAL CORRECTNESS\" TAKES AIM\n                            AT THE CONSTITUTION\n\n                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel\n\n     Testimony before Congress revealed that most \"assault weapons\" in the\nhands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony\nis consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings\nbased on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by\nsociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent\nof criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The\nfigures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the\ncriminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents\nof gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and\nprobably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of\nguns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime\ndirectly target the black market in criminal guns, and\nleave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright\nbelieves that the consequences of current \"assault weapon\" legislation on\nstreet violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun\ncontrols aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of\ncriminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new\nbusiness.{100}\n\n6.   _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about\nwould not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.

While some of the information coming from the U.S\ngovernment is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I\ndo believe that some of the things that former cult members have said\nare true.

The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\n(1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore the\nsheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury\nmorals.  His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000\nmen and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare\nand/or 'abnormal'-- masturbation, extramarital relations,\nhomosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as\nstrawberry shortcake.  \n\n     Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and\nabetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor\nfrom Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex\nrevolution and a target for character assassination.  \n\n     Judith Reisman, the prosecution's expert witness at the\nMapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey\nrevisionists as well as his Inspector Javert.  In 1983, during a radio\ninterview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of\nhaving been inolved in \"the vicious genital torture of hundreds of\nchildren.\"  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in\norder to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.  \n\n     Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a\ndifferent book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the\nsmall and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette,\nLouisiana.  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who\nhas invented a new style of intromission (\"the coital alignment\ntechnique\") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with\nconsiderable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the\nsexes.  In the book Eichel contends that \"Kinsey deliberately cooked\nthe gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance\nthe 'denormalization' of heterosexuality.\"  \n\n     If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports\nare, as the introduction boldly asserts, \"the most egregious example\nof scientific deception in this century.\"  And if they are wrong,\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear.\n\n     Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey's\ndetractors, legends are not what they used to be.  Martin Luther King\nmay have committed plagiarism.  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental\npatients around.  Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House,\npreyed on runaway boys.  Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have\nbeen disgraced for faking it in one way or another.  \n\n     So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange\npeople having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet.\nThe problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual\nprowess to pull off the job.  \n\n     As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie.  The 55-year-old\nformer songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional\nstanding, no current university position, and no peer-review\npublications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom\naccomplishments.  For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back\nthe Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited\nby others.  Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from\nCleveland's Case Western Reserve University.  Although Reisman has no\nbachelor's degree, Case granted her a master's in 1976 and a doctorate\nin 1979.  Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local\noctagenarian TV commentator.  But on the resume, Reisman gave this\npiece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: \"The\nApplication of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media\nEffects.\"\n\n     When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program, it was\nlove at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- \nporn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's\nJustice Department.  Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and\namateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual\nclimate of the United States.  \n\n     After Reisman's sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent\nof Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned \nher to meetings to discuss mutual interests.  First he tried to shovel\nher $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure\nthe brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing\nphotographs.  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but\n$734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe\nof child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust\nler.  (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the\nattorney general's pornography commission.) \n\n     When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986,\nit was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department.  That\nspring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New\nRepublic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines\naround the house.  \n\n     Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to\nscratch out a niche on the ioony right.  As the darling of the sex\ncranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in\nmen's magazines and blames AIDS on gays.  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is\nReisman's latest grasp for respectability.  Pat Buchanan, of course, is\nputting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate vindication.  \"This book\nis social dynamite,\" he says in a blurb an the front cover.  He\nespecially liked the antigay parts.  Smacking his lips in his\nsyndicated column, he declared, \"It may just blow the sewer cap off\nKinsey's monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50\naberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even\nput at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey's\n'research.'\"\n\n     The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and\nrepetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who\nmolested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their\norgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the\nFifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect\nbefore being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983.\n\n     Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud:\n\n     Mengele-like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children\nwere the basis for Kinsey's conclusions...  on childhood sexuality.\n\n     Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey\nappears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred\nchildren aged from two months to almost 15 years.\n\n     This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in\npromoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity.\n\n     In the opinion of this book's authors, that is exactly how part\nof Kinsey's child sexuality research took place.\n\n\n     Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual on\nchild molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a\nhomosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as\nReisman said: \n \n\n     [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional\npositions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A.  camp\ncounselor, boys' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he\nkept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his\nmarriage.\"\n \n\n     As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to\nelaborate even further in a recent phone interview.  \"If you've ever\nbeen around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive,\"\nhe averred.  \"Everything in his life is directed at getting children.  I\ndidn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's high\nschool picture was a quote from Hamlet: 'Man delights me not, no,\n[sic] nor woman neither.' What do you think they were picking up on?\" \n\n     Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of\nKinsey's sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey's scientific\nmodus operandi.  He was a fiendish collector.  As a young zoologist with\na D.Sc.  from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5\nmillion related insects.  When he switched to sex exploration after\nagreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he\nwas no less curious or acquisitive.  Nothing that mammals did in the\nrealm of reproduction was foreign to him.  He compiled masses of erotic\nmaterials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female\njohns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of\nmating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in\noral eroticism.  \n\n     Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros,\nfascinated him.  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors\nof adults without examining their origins.  And so with the fervor of\nhis bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though\neven his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from\nlinking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.  \n\n     Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on\nthe sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: \"Some of\nthese adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or\nother records which have been put at our disposal.\"  Although he\ngathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the\nobservations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the\ndocumentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold.  There was nothing\nlike it in the literature.  \n\n     Kinsey's main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also\nthe most unforgettable character he had ever met.  This man, whose\nhistory took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls\nas well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and\ngrandmother.  A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave\nKinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent\nboys.  Relying on the man's meticulous research, which involved\nfollowing some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to\nidentify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some\nof which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well\nas the speed and the capacity of climax.  \n\n     What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey\nhad reported as fact.  Children were indeed erotic beings from the\ncradle.  \"These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide\nan important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a\ncomponent that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy,\"\nhe concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.  \n\n     Then along came Judith Reisman.  Ignorng the legitimacy of\nKinsey's inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington.  She\nwas appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the\nportrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker.\nAnd she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal.  \n\n     Well, was he or wasn't he? Let's go to the text.  There is no\nevidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a\ntrace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or\npartaking in child sex experiments.  After 12 years on the trail,\nReisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge-\n- amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey's\ncoauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken.  It turns\nout that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume\niand in Pomeroy's 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute\nfor Sex Research.\n\n     After frisking every \"the\" and \"and\" in both books, Reisman came\nup with what she believes are \"smoking\" sentences.  To establish\nKinsey's alleged role in the planning, she says that \"there is a hint\"\nin the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey \"directed\" the\norgasm studies on kids.  She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of\narmchair psychoanalysis demanding that \"writers...test their\ntheories...by empirical study and statistical procedures.\"  Then she\ncombines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of the\nobservations of his pedophile sources \"were continued over periods of\nmonths or years until the individuals were old enough to make it\ncertain that true orgasm was involved.\"  \n\n     Putting two and two together-- Kinsey's empiricism and lengthy\nexperimentation-- she arrives at her hint.  But realizing this dog\nwould not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's\nsupposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal\ninvolvement.  As for the alleged participation, after poring over\nPomeroy's biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting\nKinsey's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex.  Here the chain of\nreasoning is more complex.  She points out that Kinsey was interested\nin clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his\nattic.  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the\npurpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming \"animal\nsex\"-- Reisman asserts that a \"similar misrepresentation may yet apply\nto Kinsey's child sex experiments.\"  Catch the \"may\"!\n\n     Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitude\ntoward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: \"Kinsey,\naccording to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things\nfor himself.  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit.\nBecause he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had\ndifficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony\nfrom a distinguished scientist.  How then did Kinsey testify to the\nactuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history' of\na sex offender?\" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their\nrecords.) \n\n     From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides,\nsperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed\nthe legendary Kinsey.\n\n     Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey\nInstitute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington.  Reached by\ntelephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied\nReisman's nasty imputations.  \"I don't understand the resistance of\npeople like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children,\" Gebhard\nsaid more in exasperation than anger.  \"That is where sex begins.  We\nwere happy to take data wherever we found it.  Even though pedophiles\ncommit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks.  They\nwouldn't be very successful if they were.  One of our best sources was\na headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club\nand sometimes went to the weddings of his former students.  As for\ndirecting experiments, that's absurd.  We never told any of our\nsubjects what to do.  lt was against our principles.  Almost all of the\npedophile material was retrospective anyway.  Nor did we ever conduct\nsex experiments with children ourselves.  That would have been highly\ninappropriate.\"  \n\n     I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual\nsituation.  \"I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped\nher teddy bear and Kinsey watched it.\"  \n\n     As for Kinsey's sex life, it is still shrouded in\nconfidentiality.  He was married to the same woman for 35 years and\nfathered four children.  Apparently, there are no huge sexual\nrevelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without\nconfirmation through the years.  Gebhard took his boss's history back\nin the '40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows.  \"We never\ndivulge anything about anybody's history, whether dead or alive,\" he\nsays.  \n\n     Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds\nthat I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we\nhave been debating each other in various forums for the past five\nyears.  In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me\nin her book for continuing \"the Kinsey practice of euphemizing\nincest.\"  My offense was using the biblical variant \"lying with a near\nrelative\" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest.  As a synonym for\nintercourse, \"lying with\" appears eight times in Genesis.  \n\n     Ed Eichel is a different story.  Though seemingly obsessed by\nKinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations.  He\ntold me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he\nwas a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in the\nearly '80s.  \"It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals,\"\nhe says.\n\n     Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey and\nthe conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was\nruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the\nheterosexual norm.  No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting\nthe joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual\ncompatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.\n\n     Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman,\nand from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born.  Eichel's main\ncontribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey\nconspiracy that supposedly seeks \"the establishment of bisexuality as\nthe balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people\" which,\nby destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual\nbehavior, \"would open the way for the second and more difficult step--\nthe ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children).\"  \n\n     When I pressed him for specific references to back up his\noutrageous contentions, he said weakly, \"You don't think Kinsey is\ngoing to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual\nand should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey\nreports.\"  \n\n     Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of\nKinsey and his data.  Perfect.  That's just what the country needs-- a\nHouse Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and\nasking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer\nor-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.\n\n\n         Elf !!!\n--\nelf@halcyon.com  (Elf Sternberg)\n\n   \"The purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas, obscure pure\nreasoning, and inhibit clarity.

My guess is that once we trash our\nenvironment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating\nand killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk.\n\nDeath and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins,\ndisease vectors,  lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies,\nnor any other way.  When we fight over which national group owns which\npiece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point\nfrom which to kill others, \"our\" land and eventually ourselves.\n\nThat is something of which to be proud.  Very proud.  Makes me glad to\nbe human.\n\n\nI'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it's fair to ask\nwhether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that\nall _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it's an artificial\ndistinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to\ncontribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else?  [In\nhistory the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive\nhardest.  If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.]\n\nThen again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can\nunderstand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I, of\ncourse, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if I must shoot Muslim\ninfants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do\nso.  That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the\nrightness of my cause.\n\n\nClearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others\nbecause they are not like you.  I would never get in the way of such\nfun.\n\nLet's see:  \n\tsoc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to Lake\n\t\tBaikal where you came from, and leave the land to the\n\t\tGreeks, who stole it fair and square from the\n\t\tScythians?\n\tsoc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistribute\n\t\tyourselves over India, as God meant for you to do?\n\tsoc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together,\n\t\tfight together, die together.

Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

A\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\nthe many?  We say \"no,\" while others say \"yes.\"\n\n>Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without\n>affecting good/responcible gun owners ??\n\n\tCan you provide a method that cannot be abused?

You might remember how a\nChamberlain \"gave a little\" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\nand how such \"appeasement\" worked.  While it might work in some\ninstances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict\nthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have a\nhistory of failure.\n\n>Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.\n>Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,\n>so a car is essential in most parts....\n>Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't \n>argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....\n\n\tCars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in\nthe USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\ncars than it does guns.  How one defines \"essential\" often depends\nupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we\nlook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.\n\n>EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were\n>more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!\n\n\tThis depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\nThus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\n\n>Is this discussion about\n>1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans\n>            or\n>2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ??\n\n\tIt is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have\nwound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that \"or\" was so logical.\n\n>Change of name.......\n\n\tThat was, on my part, purely in jest.

The squad was\nslowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students\nwere taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two\nstudents who were following and taunting.\n\nThe series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while\noccasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.\nAll at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1\nGarands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this\n45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with\nthe taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in\nthe confrontation.\n\nThere is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently\nthey had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had\nconveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio,\nJames Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known\nthat he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in.\n\nThe matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched\na civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the\nterms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not\nidentified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).\n\nIt was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently\nby General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the \nphotos, IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers.\n"}

A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\nmugger...the rapist. \n\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\nalways, there's the implied question \"what's a pretty little thing like\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\n\nBut what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10\nyears to devote learning judo?\n\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that \"rape victims\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \n\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\nwhole community.\n\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\nhelp themselves?\n\nHere's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\n\"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out.\" But if\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\n\"Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!\" they ask. How could you\nhurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from\nyou. In truth, 1% of \"defensive gun uses\" result in the offender taking\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\n\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\nmade that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more\nguns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\nWe're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\n\nBut there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\n\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\npeople. It's the way they survive.\n\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\n\"it's for your own safety\" or \"we know best\". Any person who acted\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\n\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \n\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \n\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \n\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \n\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\n\"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.\"\n\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always\nremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it\ncan lead to Tiananmen Square. \n\nWhen the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep\nthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,\nI intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter\nwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more\nsubstantial in my hand than a brick. \n\nMy opinions are, of course, my own.\n\n"}

Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just\nMembers of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers.\n\nIn the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats,\nwhich increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five\nyears, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all\nMember States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next\nelections are due in 1994.\n\nNow the voting system for these European elections still differs from one\ncountry to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election\nof the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just\nused its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections.\nBritish MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per\ndistrict; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional\nrepresentation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to\nbe a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands).\n\nThe European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its\nown members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to\ncomply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. I\nwould like to know what you people out there think of the following questions:\n\n1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every\nMember State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that\nis)?\n\n2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or\nmore MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional\nrepresentation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per\ndistrict?).\n\n3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be\ndirectly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or\nby the joint Member State governments as it is now?\n\n4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for\nelection in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would\nor could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you?\n\n5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament\nor a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government\nbody?\n\n6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels.\nMEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but\npolitical compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to\nthe status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament\nshould meet in one city only, and if yes, which?\n\nPlease post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are\nautomatically directed.

I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is a\n> reasonable assumption. \n\nNo.  It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice of\ninterpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by\nthe secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully\ndetermined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some \"right\"\ninterpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to\nread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was\nMichael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural\ninfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\nof contention between Michael and myself. \n\nI have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\nthere is some \"right\" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\ndetermine what that \"right\" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\n\n> Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\n> glasses.

He is willing to live and practice his religion\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\nimportance of this.\n\n> Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's\n> theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;\n> Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?'

The purely Christian\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\npolitical stances.  That one should love one's neighbor is a \npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \nfor homosexuality is *not*.\n\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other\nhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these \npolitical stances become most influential when presented to \nthose who need them most.)\n\n-*----\n> This is a theological statement worthy of Barth.\n> Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)\n\nHaving barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I\ndoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!\n\nRussell\n\n"}

But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority\nover the whole \nisland, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. \n    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the\nUAE has since the \nAbu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part\nof a general \nsettlement. \n    The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against\nIraq for not fully \nimplementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of\nKuwait. \n    They endorsed once again the \"Damascus Declaration,\" a pact signed\nwith Egypt and \nSyria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove\nIraqi troops out of \nKuwait. \n    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a\nfund they \nannounced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year\nwhich would have \nhelped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. \n    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of\ncontributions from each state \nalthough the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the\n$10 billion agreed \nlast year. \n    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,\nBahrain, Kuwait, Oman and \nQatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although\ntheir unity was only \nmaintained with outside help. \n    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow\nprogress of the \nconservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the\nregion that boasts \nthe bulk of global oil and gas reserves. \n    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. \n    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos\nto create a \n100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member\nagainst external \naggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. \n    Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man\n\"Peninsula \nShield\" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is\ncommanded by a Saudi \ngeneral. \n    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market\nalthough the summit \ncalled for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due\nto be held in \nSaudi Arabia next December. \n REUTER YA DYA DJG \n\n\n\nRTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT \n\n    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day\nannual summit on \nWednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three\nstrategic Gulf islands as \na condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. \n    A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the\nsettlement of a \nrow between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for\ncontinued U.N. sanctions \nagainst Iraq. \n    It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council\ndecisions following the \nexpulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. \n    The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common\nmarket, but called on \nofficials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six\nmembers to the next \nsummit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. \n    The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf\nArab states and Iran \n\"is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in\nline with its \ncommitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of\nthe sovreignty and \nterritorial integrity of the region's states.\" \n    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it\nshares with the \nUnited Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller\nislands, the Greater and \nLesser Tumbs. \n    It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified\nIranian measures \nwhich contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on\nIran to rescind \nthose measures and end the occupation which it said was \"shaking peace\nand stability in \nthe area.\" \n    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a\nsmall garrison it \nestablished there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. \n    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the\nisland for the \nUAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces\ncontinue to \nexercise their authority over the whole island. \n    The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation. \n    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the\nUAE has since the \nAbu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part\nof a general \nsettlement. \n REUTER YA DYA DJG \n\n\nRTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS \n\n (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) \n    NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter -

The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \n    \"If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh of\nBahrain should go about \nhis own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, which\nbelonged to Iran until \n1970, should be re-established,\" the paper said. \n    \"It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of\nIran's sovereignty \nover Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the\nseparation of Bahrain \nfrom Iran,\" it added. \n    The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970,\na year before the \nisland became an independent state. \n    Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully\navoided raising the \nBahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during\nperiods of \ntension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf. \n    Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of\nappeasing pro-Western \nGulf Arab rulers had backfired. \n    \"No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of\nthe Persian Gulf, it \nis the United States and the West which speak the last word,\" it said. \n    \"They (the sheikhs) are nobody,\" Salam said, adding that Iran should\nrevise its policy \ntowards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq. \n    \"Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with\nIraq...and going along with \nsome Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role\nin the formation of \nthe current situation,\" the paper said. \n    Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988,\nimproved briefly \nafter Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. \n    But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the\nensuing war, \nagain called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed\na Shi'ite Moslem \nrevolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait. \n REUTER SIJ MZ AET \n\n\n  \n"}

Azeri views on this dispute have\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\n\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\n\nThe following should be interesting. \n\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\n1991, page 28, we read:\n\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\n\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\n\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\n\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\n[AR] history of the conflict.\n\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\n \n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\n\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\n \n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\n \nIt's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the \nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\nplay dead. \n\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\n[AR] possessions?\n\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\n \n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\n\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\n \n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\n\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\nhave us believe.\n \n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\n\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\nclaim. \n\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \n\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\n\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\n\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\n\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\nwas stated as 11,000.\n\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\n\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \nMuslims in Karabakh!\n\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\nassuming no Kurds!\n\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\n\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\n  Republic.\n\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\n\n\t\t\t\tChairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN. Narimanov\n\n\t\t\t\tPeople's Commissar for Foreign Affairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGuseinov\"\n\n[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their\n[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian\n[AR] rule. \n\nNo, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\n\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\n\nNon-sequitur. \n \n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\n\nArmenian historians don't say this!\n\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\n\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \nargument totally invalid!\n\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\n\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\n\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\n\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\nArmenians.\n \n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the\n[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the\n[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.\n\nFine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian\nenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory\nis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local\npopulation! \n \n[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should\n[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as\n[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the\n[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can\n[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri\n[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.\n \nAzerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their\nown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are \nactions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war\nin isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as\nan act of Allied aggression! \n \n[AR] Dr. Alec Rasizade, senior research officer at the Academy of Sciences\n[AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of\n[AR] Columbia University in New York.\n\nHa!\n\n \n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\nS.D.P.A.

It is to kill Jews\nbecause they might be Zionists.  It is to kill people who live in\nIsrael because of where they live.

After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.\ntype folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,\nand surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\n\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\n\n\"Gun Stats\"\n\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\nQuigley, author of \"Armed and Female.\"  The article,\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\narticle states, \"A study... found that a gun in the home\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.\"  This\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\neral reasons, outlined below:\n\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a \ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to \ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun \nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\ntrator.\n\nThe study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather\nthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample \nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be \nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an \naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a \ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies \nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can \nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\nrate conclusion from them.\n\nD.F.

I would be hard pressed to identify\n    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as\n    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to\n    be police.\n    \n2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:\n    + \"We only had handguns\" - the original footage showed 4 BATF\n      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5\n      assault sub-machine gun.\n    + \"We were out gunned\" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the\n      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you\n      have the best guns available for the job.\n    + \"We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!\" -\n      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot\n      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that\n      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly\n      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are\n      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter\n      plywood.\n    + \"We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.\n       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.\n       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.\"\n      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily\n      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.\n      \n3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one\n    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would\n    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did\n    AND that they are surprised that he did.

Why all the sour grapes ?\n\nBATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending\nbudget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big\ncommando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab\nKoresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no\npropaganda value there. \n\nThe FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed\nthe situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the\nBDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. \n\nThe BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined\nthat US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their\nlittle 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on\nthe BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should\nhave surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the\nBDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like\nthe rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have\nobtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to\ndo. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies\nto themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest\nof us - at the voting booth. \n\nIf the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have\nbecome that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to\nvote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years,\nwe have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When\nthe FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem\nto mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is\nraiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand.\nWhen the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the\npublic doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in\nthe current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out\nof shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow.\n\nWaco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious\nfanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't\nblame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within\nthe parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'.\n\n-- Jim Mason \n"}

Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that\nDavid Koresh had \"explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40\nfeet into the air.\"  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of\nopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the\nfirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or\nsimilar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\n\nHere's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\ndon't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\n\nIsn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\n\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\nbody during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\nyou know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here\nbut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks\nhad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.\nAlso recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents\nused grenades on the BDs.

Following the Greek \nCypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek \narmy, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international \nagreements.

Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\n24th   December  1963.

The onslaught  of the\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\nbloodshed...\n\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\n\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\nduring the same terrible event.\n\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\nAyshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me.\"\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\n\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow\nhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I\nsuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.\n\nIt is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from\nall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any\nconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my\nperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to\nlife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what\nthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in\nfavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise\nsolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and\ndeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This\nis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own\ndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy\nwith current UK abortion law.\n\nSimilarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and\nI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even\nknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.\n\n\nmathew\n"}

This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample\nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be\nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an\naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\nrate conclusion from them.\n\nD.F.

The three of us served as governors \ntogether during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to \nimprove our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to \nupgrade the standards in American education and to improve the \nquality of instruction our children were receiving.  \n\t     \n\t     There were no two governors whom I admired more during \nthat period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher \nof the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, \nafter all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been \npassed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes \ndown to what happens between the teacher and the students in the \nclassroom.\n\t     \n\t     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National \nTeacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one \nrecognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative \nscience programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's \nclassrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA \nfingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I \nmight add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's \nCapital.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high \nschool, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science \nprograms in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national \nand international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a \nfavored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, \nincluding those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach \nfor excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and \nwhat our country needs. \n\t     \n\t     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and \nrich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a \nlifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need \ncompetence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's \nwhy Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so \npleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these \naccomplishments. \n\t     \n\t     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  \nI'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this \nApple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a \ngreat honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's \n2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have \nshown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to \nhelp redesign and improve our nation's schools.  \n\t     \n\t     We know that the quality of our children's education \nwill directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape \nin the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued \nsupport and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  \n(Applause.)\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome \nthe education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the \nnational education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize \nTracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself \na great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you \nthat the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award \nis to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to \npeople all across this country who give their lives to our children, \nall of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their \nbest to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of \nAmerica.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public \nservants.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n                                 END1:29 P.M. EDT\n\n\n\n"}

If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their \ncharter, or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good\nstart.\nThe Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though\nthat they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are\nplagued by internal strife, that is why we are not getting anywhere.\nFundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be\ntoo late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only\nvow for the destruction of Israel.\nArabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table,\ngot what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation\nbetween the two countries. \nThe tougher you play ball with Israel the tougher Israel gets.\n\nTsiel\n\n\nTsiel\n-- \n----8<--------------------------------------------------------------->8------\nTsiel:ohayon@jcpl.co.jp\t   | If you do not receive this E-mail, please let me\nEmployer may not have same | know as soon as possible, if possible.\nopinions, if any !         | Two percent of zero is almost nothing.\n"}

The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether\ncommitted in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under \ninternational law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.\n\nArticle 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the\nfollowing acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or\nin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as \nsuch:\n\nA) Killing member of the group;\nB) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\nC) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life \n   calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole \n   or in part;\nD) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\nE) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group;\n\nArticle 3.

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as\nofficers and yelling \"Police\" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug\nhouses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and\ndisplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's\na sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even\nfight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so\ncommonly, now would it?\n\nWhether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my\npoint, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear\njudgement on this issue.\n\nI merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.\nFurthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending\npotentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police\nalways knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have\nbeen allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police do\nwhen apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they\nreasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which\ncan't be faked by the \"competition\"?\n\nEven if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an\nexcuse to murder police.

This report\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\n\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\n  Transactions Regulations (\"ITRs\"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (\"IACRs\"), 31 CFR Part 535,\n  since the last report.\n\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"FAC\") of the\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\n\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\n\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\n  \"Tribunal\"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\n\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\n  was $8,638,133.15.\n\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\n  1992.\n\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (\"FCSC\") has continued its\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\n  claims in early 1994.\n\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\n\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\n  his duties.\n\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\n  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal\n  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the\n  Congress on significant developments.\n\n\n                         WILLIAM J. CLINTON\n\n\n  THE WHITE HOUSE,\n      May 14, 1993.\n\n -30-\n\n\n\n-- \nNigel Allen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada  ae446@freenet.carleton.ca\n"}

As I stated, religion\n\nThere are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.\nThe name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'\nor 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.\nThe following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun\ncuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).\n\n 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'.\n\n 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.\n\n 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.\n\nAccording to Karakashian:\n\nAs for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,\nthis is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in\nthe Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.  \n\nSaint Martin:\n\nThe name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all\nthe various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians\nas 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\nas Ermeniyye.\n \nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \nwhile 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \ntherefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.\n\nG. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\nforeigners apply to our people.'\n\nIt would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is \nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\nconnected with the word 'Hai'.\n\nHaik and Haiastan:\n\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\nthe Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance\nbetween the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\nKhoren.\n\nHaiasa:\n\nThe following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \nregion known as Armenia.\n\nProfessor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.'\n\nYensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is\nidentical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\nthat 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.\n\nMortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\n\nThe resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious\nthat we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.\n\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and\n'Haiastan' entered our older works.\n\nAccording to Karakashian: \n\n'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\n\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\nplaces.'\n\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \ninscriptions:\n\n'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"'.\n\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'\nand 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' \nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\nForrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\nit seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which\nrefers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.\n\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\n\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\n\nAccording to J. Deniker:\n\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\nfamily.\n\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\n\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \n\nInvestigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between\nArmenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics\nled him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a \ndistinct race.\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\n\n"}

Hmm...let's see: \n\n  Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that \n  led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to \n  be surprised not to know). \n  It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. \n\n  What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over \n  200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen \n  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct \n  or indirect result of western envolvement. \n\nPossibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on\nGreenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged\nimpartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental\nconsequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*\nignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping\nof millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of\nover 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of\nwork on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the\nGreenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real\nnumber seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of\nKuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've\nincluded an article I recently posted below, but this is really old\nnews.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only\na few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. \n\nFor the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to\nkill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. \n\nThe favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at\nMutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media\nplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The\ndestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out\nslaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy\nwas bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. \n Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled\non foot. \n\nFurthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded\nis completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) \n that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds\nof thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. \nYou *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,\nwas his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the\nKurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.    Yet, when it\ncomes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,\nhe would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. \nWhat a joke! \n\n\nAPn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead \n\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. \n\nBy NICK LUDINGTON \n Associated Press Writer \n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was\ntold that \nas many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put \nthe toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. \n   But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the \nPentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. \nNow, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may\nhave been \nas low as 1,500. \n   That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the \nquarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet\nfrom U.S. \ndefense sources. \n   The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of \nvastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.\nClaims \nfor a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. \n   Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking \npictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued \nunabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. \n   Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that \noriginally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles\nHorner, \nthe commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi \nmilitary death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. \n   The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of \nIraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in\nJanuary and \nFebruary 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher\nreiterated \npast statements that \"there just isn't a number,\" that is credible. \n   But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops \nkilled, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar \nwith the Pentagon's reports. \n   Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 \nby American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. \n   Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army's \nreluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense \nsystem was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles. \nThe Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the \nPatriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. \n   The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used \nagainst targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more \nmodest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. \n   The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a\nMay 1991 \nreport by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 \nIraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians \nwere also killed. \n   The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency \nestimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the\nair and \nground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate \ncould be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. \n   But as more information became available, those figures gradually were \nrevised downward. \n   The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 \nwounded after a review last year. \n   But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign\nPolicy, \nestimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives\nas low as \n1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. \n   Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of\nbodies found \nand buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.\nHe noted \nthat only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. \n   Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were \ncaptured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative \nratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like\nIraq, he \nset battlefield deaths at 1,500. \n   \"Maybe the figures are too low,\" he wrote. \"Maybe the real death toll\non the \nbattlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence\nsuggests a \ndeath toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000.\" \n   In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base\nbecause it \nwould mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of \noperations were casualties. \n   He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, \nbut rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia. \n\n\n\n \n"}

Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but\nthey do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former\nYugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H.\n\nOh, BTW, *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was \ndestroyed by Tudjman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and the international\ncommunity led by Germany.  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed\nagainst its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders\ncan be changed as well.  \n\nAs I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end\nwhen the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are\nfinally agreed upon.  Serbs, Croats, and Muslims will *all* have to\nmake territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.  \n\n-Nick\n\n\n\n\n"}

Should we use:\n    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?\n    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?\n    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?\n    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'?\n    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?\n  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter\n  which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right?\n\n------------\n\nContrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill\noff the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.\n(No, I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.)\nNote that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline\nspace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once\nexterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.\n\nSo if a \"Final Solution\" for Gaza would be so much better from\na *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?  A\ndifficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything\ngood about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit\nthe facts into the theory.\n\n\n--- D. C.

Allegations of Jewish\ndisrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are\none of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and\nrumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms\nthan blood libel.

Now that the claim has been\ndocumented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and\nshameful.

Among the issues \nof concern are land confiscation, education, prison \nconditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal \nallocation of Israel's resources.\n\nToday there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living \nwithin the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel), \nconstituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an \nempty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the \nneeds of the Jewish population. Legally and practically, \nIsrael has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early \npromises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not \nbeen fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly \naffecting the Palestinian national minority.\n\nMost Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since \n1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does \nnot receive a fair share of state resources.

It is the most\ndangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room\nand they don't know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the\nplace and announce yourself.\n\n\n>Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's\n>not an excuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was\n>almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who\n>would pretend to be cops.\n\nCops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.\n\n\nMost drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the\nlikelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they\nare arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea\nbargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will\nbe charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug\ndealers have guns for protection from their customers and other\ncriminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids\nbecause the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.\n\nNo-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to\nend in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not\ncommitted any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house\ncannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have\nthe means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the\nhousebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.\n\nThe first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to\nsearch for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal\nweapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called\nfor.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could\nhave surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven\nup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and\nserved the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh\nrefused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of\nthe t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.\n\n--\nRod Anderson  N0NZO         | \"I do not think the United States government\nBoulder, CO                 | is responsible for the fact that a bunch of\nrcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu      | fanatics decided to kill themselves\"\nsatellite  N0NZO on ao-16   |        Slick Willie the Compassionate\n"}

Will anybody\n\nA typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia, \nand today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians\nbrought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced\nnationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods\nthe Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual,\nthey will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag \nis a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with \nno border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides \nthe geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and \nthe 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which \nrenders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or \nher mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event \ncould have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case \nto occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis, \nor put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?\n\n\n                An Appeal to Mankind\n\nDuring the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational\npopulation are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of\nthe Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights\nguaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,\ndocuments signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.\n\nThe USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan\nthough they are all empowered to take necessary measures to\nguarantee life and peace.\n\nThe 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's\ntacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against\nAzerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied\nand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.\n\nSome 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly\ndeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.\nTogether with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also\nbeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.\nSome 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives \nof other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central\nAsia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee\nthem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.\n\nOne of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against\nAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the\nArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific\nexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection \nof the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nWe beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,\nfor the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are\nviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,\nits people are shot. There is persistent negative image of\nAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over \nthe whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the\nUSSR and the United States. \n\nOne of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and\ngenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance\nwhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent \nevents stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on\nAzerbaijan.\n\nIt is a well documented fact that before the conflict there\nwere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the\nissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000\nYear Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their \ncolour of skin or religion, by their residence or other\nattributes?\n\nAll people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers\nfor help and understanding. This is not the first appeal\nof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous\nappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope\nthat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda\nwill one day reveal the extent of our suffering and\nstimulate at least as much help and compassion for\nAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.\n\n\t\tTHE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO \n                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES \n                OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR\n\n\n\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive.\"\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

Says who? Why can mon & pop have FOA, but IBM be forced, and force is\nthe correct word here, to have REO? As purchase of IBM is voluntary, then\nthere are very well defined procedures on how IBM chooses to do some things\nand chooses to do other things. Why not let those same procedures work for\nemployment policies?\n\n\n    >Similarly, if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings\n    >in which he does not live, and which are managed by an\n    >independent management agency, then whose freedom of\n    >association are we protecting?

If the landlord and the tenant can't agree, then they\nboth can cease from using each other's property.\n\nSuddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA. And on what\nbasis does the FOA of the landlord \"disappear\"?\n\nIt seems that vague terms like \"no contact with tenants\" suffice.\n\nWell, I think FOA is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and by\ngolly, if the State is going to make it suffer, I sure would like to see the\nheinous crime that justifies the removal of this right.\n\nI don't think \"no contact\" with the tenats is even a crime, much less something\nthat should cause severe interference with important rights.\n\n    >I suspect that the majority of the people in this country\n    >agree with my position on these extreme cases, particularly\n    >if they are presented in this manner.

I assume that when you say \"publicly owned\", you are talking about those\nquasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders.\n\nThe companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. They\ncan give you a list of all of their owners. They have no \"anonymous\",\nunknown to them, owners.\n\n\n    >By the way, the above analysis is based on the assumption\n    >that the right to freedom of association and the right to an\n    >equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal\n    >importance.

And that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because it\nis based only on might makes right. Sort of like saying, \"nobody has a right\nto live\", whereupon I whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument.\n\n\n-- \nThere are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of\nenvironmental disaster.

Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein\nare outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the\nabsurd things he says.

That is but one example.\n\nNow in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different\nmatter.  And to you and to Brian, relativity does play a big role.\nWhat we perceive to be true, depends on our vantage point.

Unless\n  they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger\n  then \"the best they could\" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT.\n\n  Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a\n  strong possibility of it.  I, for one, said that in the event of\n  an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger\n  either from the assault itself or from a \"Jonestown\" (my phrase\n  a week after the seige started) style suicide.  And as I pointed\n  out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net \n  who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they\n  have no right to impose this choice on their children.\n\n  Now, while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I \n  have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their\n  own or to take the advice of experts.  The cult specialist inter-\n  viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly \"stonewalled\"\n  by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational\n  tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so \n  increased the chance of a tragic outcome.\n\n>Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were\n>done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give\n>me a break.\n\n  Give *US* a break!   Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound \n  filled with CHILDREN?!!   This doesn't seem to show much regard for \n  their lives or safety.   \"Nontoxic teargas\" is an oxymoron.  Children\n  have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions\n  induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone\n  subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease.\n\n  If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the \n  madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the\n  death of the hostage as the madman himself.  These kinds of situations\n  have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with\n  tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud-\n  speakers at all hours.   That approach is idiotic.  \n\n\n>Be part of the solution - not the problem.\n\n  The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the \"the authorities\".\n  The Feds showed themselves here, as they have so many times in the\n  past, to be a gang of trigger-happy, impulsive, yahoos who cause more\n  trouble than they prevent.    Their confrontational approach reinforced\n  every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee-\n  ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed\n  willingly.

Sounds a bit\n>>tacky, but hey, whatever works.\n\nAs David Veal points out, this sort of \"promotion\" would be used\nagainst gun owners by the mass media.\n\nHowever, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,\nfree, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40\nor $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.\n\nOur Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished\nteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been\nvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices\ninterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but\nfeel they should know something about \"gun safety\" since members\nof their family keep guns at home.\n\nTeaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:\n\n(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases\n    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.\n\n(2) A \"gun safety\" class is Politically Correct, and likely to\n    be viewed positively by the public and the media.\n\n(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)\n    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a\n    gentle introduction to firearms.\n\n(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun\n    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.\n\n(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners\n    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,\n    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate\n    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun\n    students sometimes tell us they have \"something new to think\n    about\" with regards to personal gun ownership.\n\n(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.\n\nOur course is the standard NRA-certified \"Home Firearm Safety\"\nclass, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also\nteach the NRA's \"Personal Protection\" class, although the cost\nis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.\n\nI think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to\ngun buy-backs.\n\n                               -- Alane --\n   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    \"I am a jelly doughnut\"      \\\n /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\\n/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n"}

{"group": "talk.religion.misc", "text": "From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre)\nSubject: Theists And Objectivity\nOrganization: University of Nebraska at Omaha\nLines: 82\n\nCan a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).

Even\nif they do that is *MANY YEARS* in the future--until which they are a burden\non someone, or society.  There is also the matter of the mother.  Forcing\nher to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent\nher from being a productive member of society.\n\n>>Actually, I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion, not\n>>those who object to federal funding.

It is \n>discriminatory that I cannot make that choice, and so you must pay for it.\"  \n\n>That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or \n>otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill [sic] for that choice.\n\nOk, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will\ntake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice\nC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have\nto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they\ntake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next\n18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay\nfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen\nnot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid\nfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in\nconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly\nlegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded\nbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going\nto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those\nwomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice\nB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\n\"taxes\" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\nobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,\nas I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that\narea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)\n\n\n>>If you disagree then give us some \"reasons\".

Uncle Bill doesn't pay for \n>breast augmentation, facelifts, etc...  Why abortions?  It's elective \n>surgery!  \n\nThose other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings\nin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.\n(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)\nThis is quite different from the case of abortion.\n\n>As for your argument, you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making \n>it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too, SO YOU \n>ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS!  Think about \n>it.  A poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded, what's she \n>gonna do.  What choice have YOUR PLANS given her.  Your kind of double-\n>talk really makes me ill.\n\nThis is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing \"to make the alternative affordable\ntoo\".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*\nyour statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't.\nIf Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left\nit out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be\nquite surprised.\n\n\n>\"Pro-choice\".  Ha!  Pro-Abortion really fits in your case.\n\nYes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.\n\n>If you're gonna fund one choice, you have to fund them all, at the very \n>least.\n\nYOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the\none who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.\n\n>        IMHO if we fund the adoption choice right, (meaning not just \n>throwing money at it but cutting costs, esp. legal costs) we won't need \n>abortion anymore.\n\nYour humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still\nthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman\ncould need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, entering\ncollege, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to\ndo if you have to \"take a break\" for a few months...things that have a massive\nimpact on her future productivity.)\n\n\n>>have a \"right to life\".

Instead officers armed with grenades\ninvaded the property.

Yeah right.\n\n>The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.\n\nNo it did not - you have a source for this slander of course?\n\n>Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not\n>attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.\n\nThe men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the\nmen. It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else.\n\n>To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the\n>Holocaust is absurd.\n\nOn that we agree at least.\n\n>The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The\n>village had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.\n\nYes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed.\nThis is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report\non the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report.\nThe Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour\nGovernment. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for\nsome reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either.\nPerhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then\nthere will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied\nbehind their backs, no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for\nsome reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You\nhave a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it. The facts are\nexactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder\nnothing else. No Iraqi soldiers, no other fighting. Just ethnic cleansing\nat work.\n\nJoseph Askew\n\n-- \nJoseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades,\njaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief.\nDisclaimer?

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal \nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law \nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled \nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  \nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day \nstandoff ensued.  \n\t     \n\t     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every \nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without \nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were \nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were \ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably \ninsane.      \n\n\t     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both \nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, \nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the \naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination \ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no \nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal \nagents against the compound.  \n\t     \n\t     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on \nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on \nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  \nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even \nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause \npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people \nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n\t     \n\t     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I \ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I \nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what \nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the \nimplementation of the decision.  \n\t     \n\t     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  \nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal \nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his \ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not \nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate \nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n\t     \n\t     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the \nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and \nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to \nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been \ndone differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent \nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I \nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required \nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to \ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can \ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n\t     \n\t     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney \nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the \nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult \ncircumstances.  \n\t     \n\t     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry \nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end \nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be \ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David \nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over \nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult \nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will \nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future \nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what \nhas been learned now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, \nafter 51 days, you decided --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is \nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation \nwith --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go \nfirst and then the other.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I \ncan't do it at once.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about \nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General \nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another \nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she \ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted \nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause \npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it \nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was \nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.  \n\t     \n\t     I was further told that under no circumstances would our \npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to \nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and \nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful \nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  \nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n\t     \n\t     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I \nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons \nI was given were the following:\n\t     \n\t     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the \nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the \nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be \nneeded in other parts of the country.\n\t     \n\t     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had \nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced \nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to \nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult \nmembers to come out.  \n\t     \n\t     Number three, that the danger of their doing something \nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with \nthe passage of time.\n\t     \n\t     And number four, that they had reason to believe that \nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused \nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and \nunsafe conditions.\n\t     \n\t     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  \nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had \ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and \nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said \nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were \nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only \nincrease with the passage of time.\n\t     \n\t     The third question I asked was, has the military been \nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, \nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious \nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military \npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some \nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the \nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they \nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one \nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military \n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming \nsignificance.\n\t     \n\t     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I \nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she \nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that \ntoday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were \ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only \nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only \nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to \nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather \nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who \nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into \ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events \nto unfold.  \n\t     \n\t     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people \nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General \non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  \nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry \nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it \nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that \nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n\t     \n\t     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised \nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the \nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics \nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this \nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These \npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were \nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, \nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to \navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate \nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the \nchildren.  \n\t     \n\t     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, \nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you \nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why \nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she \nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those \nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly \nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier \nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for \nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can we assume then that you don't think this was \nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of \npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really \ndecide that way?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume \nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has \ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of \ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the \nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry \nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we \nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have \nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say \nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make \nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want \nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have \nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but \ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best \nevidence we have.  \n\t     \n\t     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of \nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it \nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, \nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is \nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the \npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, were there any other options \npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from \nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all \nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go \nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good \njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued \nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them \nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of \nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to \nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the \nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things \njust began to spin downward.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened \nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not \ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with \nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they \nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get \npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  \nThat's what they thought.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the government know that the children did not \nhave gas masks?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     congressional hearings once the situation -- are \nyou in agreement with that?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do \nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the \nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring \nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any \ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully \ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the \nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the \ncountry.\n\t     \n\t     Go ahead, Sarah.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The \nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not \nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance \nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was \nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived \nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't \nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their \nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had \nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What federal laws --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't \nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the \nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they \nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but \nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of \nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of \nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were \nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that \nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have \nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.  \n\t     \n\t     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground \ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be \nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if \nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane \nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace \nwhere they could be protected.  \n\t     \n\t     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned \nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas \nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks \nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they \nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a \nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked \nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you \nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your \nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had \nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the \npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that \nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues \nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would \nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in \nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were \nright or wrong, of course, we will never know. \n\t     \n\t     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the \nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate \nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were \nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  \nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a \nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't \nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't \ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I \ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I \nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to \nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had \nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, \nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. \nAnd I do support her.  \n\t     \n\t     She is not ultimately responsible to the American \npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an \nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as \nwell as she could have.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END1:55 P.M. EDT\n"}

I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is\na reasonable assumption. \n\n>And who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\n>are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\n>reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\n\nMichael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\nglasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the\nNT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some\npoints in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly \nabrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with\nadequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew,\nand probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )\n\nThis part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:\n\nmls> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n>No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \n>seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\n>gospel.\n\nRussell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate.\nMichael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, \nwhich seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are \npossible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton\nwas a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis\nwas a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?\n\nmls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\nmls> tell you something about Christianity? ...\n\nMichael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have\ntwo hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) )\nRussell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's\ntheological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;\nDean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More\ndirect, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?'\nThe implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the \ntradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea\nof the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition!\n\n>The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\n>se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\n>gays.  \n\nHow can one answer this while staying on the more general issue?\nI'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael)\non this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement.\n\nOne verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from\nPaul (of all people):\n\n'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28\n{I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry \nthem in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' \n(roughly, from Romans).

(305 pages). \n(Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 \n million Muslim people)\n\n\"Foreword:\"\n\n\"For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque, \n the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border \n of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked \n Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and \n the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, \n I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of \n those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.\" \n\np. 202 (first and second paragraphs).\n\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead.\" \n\np. 15 (second paragraph).\n\n\"The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages \n and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of \n their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley \n to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following \n the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt \n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.\"\n\n\"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.\"\n\np. 20 (second paragraph).\n\n\"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \n fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they\n smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last\n Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,\n unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and\n the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.\"\n\np. 109 (second paragraph).\n\n\"As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative\n experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself\n incompetent to rule by legitimate means.\n\n The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and\n outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing\n body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to \n do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their \n fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.\n\n The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,\n as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \n of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\n of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of\n those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became\n a common way of paying debts.\"\n\np. 203 (first paragraph).\n\n\"A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the\n point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock \n and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him\n sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising\n it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!\n Slodkey!' (Sweet.)\"\n\np. 203 (second paragraph).\n\n\"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\n sobs.

There were also bodies of the\n dead.\"\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n\"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old.\"\n\np. 118.\n\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed.\"\n\np. 192.\n\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered\n into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores\n that had been left by the Turks.\"\n\np. 193.\n\n\"Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages\n were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.\"\n\np. 195.\n\n\"The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order\n of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians.\" \n\np. 218. (First and second paragraphs)\n\n\"Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians \n did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, \n the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace \n actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.\n\n I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,\n in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless\n and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the\n heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,\n and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with\n their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.\"\n\np. 133 (first paragraph)\n\n\"In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who\n had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians\n abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of\n these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the\n brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,\n mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method\n employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after\n crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw.\"\n\np. 19 (first paragraph)\n\n\"The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of\n ruins.

Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for\nrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.\nSome 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees\nin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%\nunemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used\ncar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you\ncould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and\nnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,\nno entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've\nsaved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your\nkids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri\noutright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an\nexaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other\npeople's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also\nbuy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping\nin a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter.

Extra is kept for\nthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that\nsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant\ncrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If\nyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a\ngood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something\nelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the\npublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with\nanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the\nuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient\nto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house\nand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow\nto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness\nsubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no\nmore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a\ndeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger\nhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan\nand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public\ngood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and\nmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in\nservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided\namong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid\noperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy\nmachine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their\ncouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't\nso hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is\nrealize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a\nrigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could\nbe already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been\nmaking the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the\nmerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted\nyour 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones\nwho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when\nyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but\nkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a\npoor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying\nthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed\ntheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been\nenslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we\nare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own\nland they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to\nown it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,\npaynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!\nI have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I know\nwhat I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be\nlet out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her to\nlive on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewise\nenslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make\nthings just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she\ndestroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and\ntheir heirs. That would be worth it.

{"group": "talk.politics.guns", "text": "From: lvc@cbnews.cb.att.com (Larry Cipriani)\nSubject: Don Kates' talk on the Branch Davidians\nOrganization: Ideology Busters, Inc.\nKeywords: Kates\nLines: 110\n\nThis was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:\n\nI recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk\nat the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was\nall set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy\nconclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough\nsummary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as\nexactly what he actually said...\n\nKates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire\nthan the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not\ndiscuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.\n\nKoresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This\nisn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has\nbeen ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel\nhatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to\npeople like Koresh.\n\nLengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.\nThere were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.\nPolice originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they\ncalled local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for\nprotection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were\nchanged to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many\nsmall police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not\nlarge enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of\norganizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the\nFBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they\nwere to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).\n\"All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that\npower.\"\n\nThe BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid\nillegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners\nno longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills\ndisappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its\nexistence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.\nAround the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media\nis alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a\npre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door\nand the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a\ngun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't\ninvited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but\nif any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents\nremoving armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in\nchains.\n\nThe Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for\nreview.\n\nKates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and\nthat the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot\nat, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100\nagents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had\nsome medical personnel on hand.\n\nHe confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest\nin connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on\nthe phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and\nthe sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could\nbe tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns\nback.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached\nrationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.\n\nThe BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they\naudit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his\nfollowers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and\nthey reacted accordingly.\n\nWith respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates\nwas giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that\nthe BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their\ninformants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had\nmore to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been\ncompletely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to\nknock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for\nthus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,\nthen it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns\ndown the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF\nbreaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the\nDavidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served\nwarrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A\nclose look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_\nhave shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was\nthe first shot fired!\n\nThe role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial\nposition on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the\nview that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held\noff a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI\nwent in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was\nbeginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the\npublic's sympathy.\n\nShould the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,\ndiverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents\nlike this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,\nwell-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have\neven more tragic results.\n\n   - Lyn Bates\n     (bates@bbn.com)\n\nPS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston\nCollege Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or\nplace, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that\ninformation.\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n"}

They are Pomaks and Gypsies.\n\nOboy, this is exciting. First you discuss your non-existent literature\ntastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism.\nAre you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and\nRevisionism Triangle?\n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? \n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nThe longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles\nand on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have\nordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\n|1|\n\nHELSINKI WATCH: \"PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE\"\n\nAnkara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the \"Helsinki Watch\"  it is\nstated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced\nwith problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being\nimplemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.\n\nThe report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government\nshould grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of\nminorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and\nin addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the \"Turkish\nMinority\" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify\nthemselves as 'Turks'.\n\nNEWSPOT, May 1992\n\n|2|\n\nGREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS\n\nThe  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek\nstate is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish\nminority with Turkey.\n\nPointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is\ncalled \"Greek\"  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the\nminority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with\nthe Greek  newspaper \"Ethnos\" he said:  \"I am a Greek  citizen of\nTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western\nTrace are also Turkish.\"\n\nEmphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in\nWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement\nsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey\nin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.\n\nRecalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.\nSadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,\nFaikoglu said.  \"In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\nrights.\"\n\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\n\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\n\n|3|\n\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\n\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\n\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\nan Athenian magazine.\n\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\nmagazine  \"ENA\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\ngeneral election.\n\n  Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\"\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that \"Greece  should recognise\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\nare falling.\"\n\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\n\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\n\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\n\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\n\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\nlargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the\nUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections\nare over.\n\n================================================================\n                M.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the \nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \nsites?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three \nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\n\t     \n\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \nthey have troops on the ground there.\n\t     \n\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \nthink we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a \npolicy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I follow up?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \nto stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.\n\t     \n\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making \nprogress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and \nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \nthe region.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the \nsituation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I \ndon't know that the administration could have made it different.\n\t     \n\t     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the \nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies \nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \nin only a decade.  \n\t     \n\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \nThat's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \nare moving in the right direction economically.\n\t     \n\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \ndidn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \nThere are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I \njust disagree with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been \nunderway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \nargument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates \nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \nforward.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just \nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \nbasically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days \nwith regard to the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Waco --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have \nmuch to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \ninsights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole \nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry \nthat they killed their children.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \nPerot said today that you're playing games with the American people \nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \npackage.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign \nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \nresubmit them to the Hill?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \nWe're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going \nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \nthat rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. \nPerot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a \nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if \nmaybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and \nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \npolitical criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you \nthink you can sit back and just --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's \nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's \ngot some constructive ideas.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the American people have shown that they're very \nimpatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one \nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \neven if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my \njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will \nchange people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \ndebate and not just to the President.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \nunilaterally?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \nmandate of the United Nations.\n\n\t     Q\t  But you have a mandate and --\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \nthat we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for \naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \nWe are not.  \n\n\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \nwe have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French \nand others about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would that be military action?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in \nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \ngrip?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's \nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \nthese are things you said that you didn't support.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we \nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \nqualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \ndon't know exactly what he said.\n\t     \n\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss \nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going \nto do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies \nspeaking out of school.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's \na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had \na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a \nline against an administration policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I \ndon't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \nBut I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies \nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \nwhen you tell people they can't do certain things in this country \nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\n\t     \n\t     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been \nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \nof their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \non this issue?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \nof emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \nand in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to \nsee it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my \ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \nand that's what I'll continue to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \nBosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on \nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \nyour decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on \nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \ndecision?  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There \nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \nrequired to embark on any new policy.\n\t     \n\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \nwar.  \n\t     \n\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\n\t     \n\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't \ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \nwe couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \nthese wars?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument \nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  \nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \nof ethnic tensions exist.\n\n\t     Q\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \nYeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the \nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \n\n\t     Q\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more \ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \nhandle that situation differently now?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that \nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come \nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to \nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \nhave asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \nSessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \nhis future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing \nbefore you do decide?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \nI'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \nto do with the direction of the FBI.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \ntake a partisan view in this war?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \nbe successful.\n\t     \n\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \nlooking at what else we can do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \nAren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \nGermany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've \ngot all of our options under review.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \nmilitary operation?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  \nThat's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \nde facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  \nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \npower.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're \ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \n\t     \n\t     I do believe that there's every reason to think that \nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail \nthere.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of \nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\n\t     \n\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \nrefinance their debt.  \n\t     \n\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \ntough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  \nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the \ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \nof this country.  \n\t     \n\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \nmillions of Americans.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \nSo I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  \nI feel good about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that \none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \npractically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own \ncountry, how can we do it for them?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \nIt's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be \nfair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \nbe tied by many members of Congress.\n\n\t     Q\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \nThe Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and \nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \npursued.  \n\n\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \nwill do that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \n\n\t     Q\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \norder to then build support for Russian aid?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \ntoward reform.\n\t     \n\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \neconomy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And \nin a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all \nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \nbecause they haven't produced the results that the people so \nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \n\t     \n\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \nthat's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \nthink that we should support that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready \nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \nagreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental \nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \n\t     \n\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \nposition, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty \nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an \nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \nviolating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an \napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out \nthe details of that.\n\t     \n\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only \nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \nregion, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot \nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \nknow, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for \nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong \nabout the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not \nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \ndetails needed to be improved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\n\t     \n\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \nevaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \nthink that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \ninterchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know \nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't \nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I \nwas encouraged by the last trip.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \nus to confirm good faith?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases \nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \nthose cases.  And we're not there yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \nvery influenced by how the families feel.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \nDole?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \nPresident, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all \nstrung out and we're divided.\"  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \nhundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could \nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \nBut the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and redo --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \nwe need more police officers on the street.  \n\t     \n\t     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once \nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \nstreet who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's \nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \nright to know the names of the senior officers?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \nan Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I \nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \nmight be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think \nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I \nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \n\t     \n\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \ncon.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing \nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \nforces, sir?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \ninto a ground war there?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our \nevaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never \nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \nparticipating in some of the activities? \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't \nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \nbe done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of \nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \nAnd that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \nbe here, but for others as well.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.\n\n                                 END1:48 P.M.

Cases that come to mind are the\ninvasion of Panama, the war with Iraq, the disaster in Waco,\nthe issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the\nmilitary, the war on drugs, and many others.\n\nThe story that you bring to light was regarding the new\nsex survey.  While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of\nthe data was ommitted from the article, I would venture to\nguess that the data that was presented did not deviate\nfrom the survey.  I do, however, think that it would be\nfolly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's\nanalysis of this data.  In this particular case, there was\nlittle analysis, and the reader was left to draw his/her\nown convictions.\n\nMany netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the\nAmerican media are merely a number of businesses, who's\npurpose in life is to make money for their owners and\nstockholders.

Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents \nand Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S.

His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim\npopulation of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological\ntendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before\nthe outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted\nin the 'Hairenik Weekly:' \n\n\"The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall \n see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations\n and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to\n the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are\n strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.\n On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is\n bereft of social sanctities.\"[2]\n\n[1] K.

Zarmooni.\n\nIn April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.\nA number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \n\n\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \n spirit of the Nazi ideas.\"\n\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\nhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels\nPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language\nradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were\nproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]\n\n[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.\n[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900\n    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg\n    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.\n\n\nThe establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored\nby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the\nestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any \nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \n\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\n'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\nAs such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians\nwere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August \n1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of\nRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.\n\n[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported\non in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action\nis as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a \nweapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!)\nand that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile \naction he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!)\nRepeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking\ngun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and\nI will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's\n ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's\npracticality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45)\nIF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER\nWILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not\nbother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a\nBystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)\ncall the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on \nthe ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will\nuse it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and\nthat of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none\ncame forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded\nwith the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special\npurpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing\nlawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you\nfully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can\nthink of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the\nGlaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose\nand stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.\n(ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not \nricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often\ncross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with\none shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court.\nBe as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were.\nRepeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the\nsame questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see\nif your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification\nand weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your\n politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!)

{"group": "talk.religion.misc", "text": "From: neese@cerritos.edu\nSubject: Hell\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Cerritos College, Norwalk CA\nLines: 110\n\n    In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words \ntranslated into the word \"hell\".  These Greek words have totally different \nmeanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.\n\n    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the \nNew Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...\nmeaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be \nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\n\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \n\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the \ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\n\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \n\"shadowy realm.\"  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \nthis hell.\n\n    The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \nreserved unto judgment...\"\n\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\n\n    Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \nis there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\".\n\n    The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\"  Hinnom is a \ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\n\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \ntheir children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech.  The rites were \nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief \ngroves in the valley).\n\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later \nthe valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for \nsewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were \nalso burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding \nby a constant supply of garbage and refuse.\n\n    Aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchased with the money Judas received for\nthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.\n\n    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  \n\n    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working \nreligious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the \nre-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.\nTheir fate is revealed by the apostle John: \"And the beast was taken, and with \nhim the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire \nburning with brimstone.\"\n    \n    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this \"hell\") be?\n\n    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: \"For \nTophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is \nprepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, \nthe breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" (Isa.30:33).\n\n    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled \nfiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).\n\n    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible \nsay that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of \nfire?\n\n    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be \nthrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will \nbecome of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? \n \n    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna \nfire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This \npunishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the \n\"second death\" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a \nfurther resurrection.\n\n    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.\n                           \n    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. \"For, behold, the day \ncometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do \nwickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\"\n(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be \"ashes under the \nsoles of your feet...\"(Mal.4:3).\n\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \ntorture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or \nvalley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, \nbut ashes!\n \n    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means \ncomplete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The \nBible says, in Romans 6:23, \"The wages of sin is death\", not eternal life in \ntorture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of \nlife. \n    \n    Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD!\n"}

Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\n\"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of \"human rights?\"\nWhere are you?\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

Look, if you can't measure\nthe impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test\nevaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.

The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights\n3.   The Human Rights Charter\n4.   The European Convention of Human Rights\n\nIf one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these\nlegally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is\nobvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.\n\n\nThe people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion\nby the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live\nunder Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.\n\nThey are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole\nreason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any\nprovisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.\nIsrael's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing\nthe return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of\nthe State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under\ninternational law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It\nwould facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east\nand constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence -\nin the area. Any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the\nIsraeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities, is fraught with\ngenociadal implications.

Greek\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\n\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\n\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\n  Empire.>>\n\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

Apologies to those who've\nseen the following before:]\n\nTo explain my position on the \"War On Drugs,\" I offer this:\n\nDrugs And Crime: A New Approach\n\nby Ken Barnes\n\n\nGiven that:\n\n1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for \nmuch of the crime which afflicts our nation.\n\n2. People who want drugs (particularly people who \nare predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get \nthem, whether or not they are legally available.\n\n3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs \nare readily available to those who want them.\n\n4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is \nresponsible for a significant drain on the productive \nresources of our country, and this occurs in a variety \nof ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are \nunable to learn, to the spread of disease among \naddicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse \nand tobacco smoking.\n\n5. A general economic principle of government is \nthat whatever is subsidized you get more of, and \nwhatever is taxed you get less of.  To be most \neffective in confronting the nation's drug problem, \nsome way must be found to utilize these additional \npowers of government to make drug dealing and drug use \nless attractive.\n\nWhile this country's current efforts to combat \nlegal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is \na greater awareness of the health consequences of \nsmoking, and designated-driver programs have helped \nreduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be \nsaid for the \"war\" on illegal drugs.  There remains a \ncore group of illegal drug users which support \ninternational networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, \nprocessors, kingpins, and gangsters.  These networks \nand their \"marketing activities,\" which include drive-\nby shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, \nand smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly \nresponsible for a large proportion of the crimes \ncommitted in our country every day.\n\nClearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are \nlinked.  It takes only a moment's reflection to \nrecognize how they are linked.  The link is money.  As \nwith this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol \nconsumption, a black market has been created, in which \ngreedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a \nbygone era, have profited enormously from their \nillegal trade.  The victims of this trade include not \nonly the innocent people unfortunate enough to be \ncaught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug \nusers themselves.\n\nWere it not for the black market, and the violent \nmonopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be \nthe thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they \nhave become in order to pay the high prices the drug \nlords demand.  In the absence of the drug lords, most  \nwould be, I believe, simply people with a problem, \neither a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a \ncriminal problem.\n\nLet me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that \nwe let the criminals who have been preying on our \nsociety for these many years of Prohibition off the \nhook.  On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is \none which would not result in either the government or \nprivate industry getting into the business of \npromoting crack cocaine, or any other presently \nillegal drug for that matter.  Neither is it an \napproach which sees law abiding citizens handing over \nmore and more of their freedom and privacy in an \neffort to track down illegal drug users, until \"the \nland of the free and the home of the brave\" looks like \na police state.\n\nHere then is my proposal:\n\n1. Possession and use of all presently illegal \ndrugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them \nremains illegal.  'Potheads' can grow their own \nmarijuana (as many already do today), other drug users \ncan legally import their poison of choice as long as \nthey pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug \nexperimenters develops.\n\n2. Because of the barter economy which supplies \nthe drug users, the black market profits that have so \nenriched the drug lords dwindle.  If these drugs can \nbe obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy \nthem?  Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek \nto sell these \"noncommercial\" drugs even at relatively \nlow prices.  Therefore,\n\n3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on \nthose individuals who continue to buy and sell, and \nalso on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to \nafford even low prices.  But here is where the \nstrategy begins to differentiate between the drug \ndealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their \nvictims.\n\n4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are \npermitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a \ndrug test.  Those who choose to cooperate are informed \nthat upon conviction for the crime they are accused \nof, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be \ninstitutionalized until they are clean, and only then \nwill they begin to serve their sentence.  If they \nchoose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they \ncan begin to serve their sentence right away.  Those \nwho choose not to undergo the drug test and are \nconvicted face stiffer fines and serve longer \nsentences.\n\n5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals \nserves several purposes:\n\nDrug using criminals (and this includes drunk \nand/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their \nsources of supply, thus reducing the total number of \ndrug users in society at large, and consequently \ndecreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting \nmore of the remaining drug dealers out of business.\n\nInstitutionalization provides an incentive for \ndrug using criminals to straighten themselves out, \nbefore becoming part of the general prison population.\n\nWhile helping protect society from crime, \ninstitutionalization could also serve to deter drug \nusers from becoming criminals, since drug using \ncriminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed \nprior to serving their sentences by the additional \ntime it takes for them to sober up.\n\nInstitutionalization of drug using criminals \nseparate from the general prison population would also \nprovide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could \nvolunteer for research studies of new techniques and \ntreatments for addictive disease, with the potential \nto benefit both themselves and others.\n\n6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not \ndrug users themselves, and this is particularly true \nof the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit \norganizations.  Under this proposal, dealers would be \nmore readily identifiable, since upon arrest they \nwould presumably pass the drug test, or else decline \nto take it in order to avoid having to explain why \nthey are in possession of drugs when it is apparent \nthey do not use them.  Declining to take the test, \nthey would of course face stiffer penalties.  While \neach case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug \nwould have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of \na suspect's drug test could provide additional \nevidence for the prosecution.\n\n7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to \nthe decline of smoking in our country by making \ncigarettes more costly while at the same time \nproviding revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, \nnoncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money \ngenerated should be used to combat their use.  \nEnforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis \nhowever, and should not be used as an excuse to \ninfringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial \ndrug users, since to do so would have the effect of \nreintroducing Prohibition.\n\nInstead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the \ntax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever \nfound in their possession during the course of routine \npolice operations, they will be required to pay the \ntax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to \nbe destroyed.  If drug dealers are found to be selling \nnoncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, \nthey will face additional prosecution for evading the \ntax.  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug \ndealing charges is already in use in some \njurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently \nlimited by the illegality of drug possession.\n\nRevenue from drug possession taxes and import \ntariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising \ncampaigns, and provide support to private sector drug \ntreatment programs for those unable to afford \ntreatment.\n\n8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must \nbe ended.  Federal support of tobacco farming is both \nimmoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and \nthe marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands \nin many states must likewise be eliminated.\n\nWhile my proposal would have the effect of \npermitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it \nwould hold the users of all drugs responsible for \ntheir actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm \ndrugs have on our society, particularly the crime \ncaused by the illegal drug trade.  So long as we \nremain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, \nand freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always \nhave a drug problem.  Whether it takes the form of \nheroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk \ndrivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or \nemphysema patients struggling for breath after a \nlifetime of smoking, the results are the same: \nneedless suffering and death.  As a society we must \nrecognize that while our society permits us to harm \nourselves with drugs, as we are already doing \n(regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand \nagainst the harm that drugs and drug users cause to \nothers.  We must particularly oppose the vicious and \nviolent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug \nusers.  By taking the profits out of their deadly \ntrade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting \ndown these powerful criminal organizations.\n\nThe question of whether drug use is a moral or \nmedical problem depends on which group of drug users \nyou're talking about.  Different drugs have different \neffects, and some are more addictive than others.  The \naddictiveness of a drug also often varies between \nindividuals, and so we have some people who can drink \nalcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot \nresist the bottle.  Nicotine, which former Surgeon \nGeneral C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as \nheroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, \nand while some people can stop smoking by willpower \nalone, others continue to smoke even after treatment \nfor lung cancer.\n\nFor those individuals who can stop taking drugs \non their own, we may argue that because they have \nchosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on \ntheir part, or an unwillingness to face the \ndifficulties of life.  But for the addicts, while they \nmay have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the \ntime they discover their addiction it is too late.  We \ncannot hold them responsible for their disease, any \nmore than we would blame someone who is drowning for \nan inability to swim.  Perhaps they should have known \nnot to go near the water, or perhaps someone should \nhave warned them of the danger, but in their present \ncircumstances warnings will not help.  Neither does it \nhelp for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing \nthem weights. \n\n\n--Standard disclaimer-- \n*.x,*dna**************************************************************\n*(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg.      * Conservative libertarians     *\n* \\'  KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu    *      for Pro-Balance!         *\n*(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com**********************\n\"I find television very educating.

Similarly, a moral relativist will not judge one moral system\nto be better than another in every possible circumstance.  This does not,\nhowever, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another\nin a specific set of circumstances.

This so called \"Earth Summit\" is \nscheduled to convene in  Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of \nglobal envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on \nthe population of the United States and other industrialized nations.\nSuch policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They \nare based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming \nfollows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We \ndo not agree. \nA survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, \nconfirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming \nobserved during the past century. A recently published research paper even \nsuggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar \nactivity),  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the \nglobal temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880.\nFuthermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that \nthe theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming \ncannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. \nYet all predictions are based on such theoretical models.\nFinally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide \nlevels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on \nworld food supply.\nWe are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, \nare pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent \nchanges in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global \nregulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, \nstandards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences \nfalling on developing countries and the  poor.\nDavid B.

The reasons are pragmatic: even if\n>Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\n>Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\n>clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although\n\nI am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been \nborn from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, \nyet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself \na Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,\nnot a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying\nwith the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by \nWesterners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: \n\n\"If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the\nnations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have\nopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. \nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own\nway\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\ncountries.\"[1]\n\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\nRomanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).\n\n\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\nadvanced European countries.\"[2]\n\n\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\nhappy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\n\n\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection.\"\n\n\"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \npriests.\" (A. Ubicini).[4]\n\n[1]  Ah. Djevat, \"Yabancilara Gore Eski Turkler,\" 3rd ed.

They will also be permitted to\ntrade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they\nthemselves grow or manufacture.  They will not, however be able\nto legally sell their drugs for money.  Both manufacture and\nimportation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed, to discourage\ntheir use. \"This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?\"\n\n> |3.

Much too big brotherish for my tastes.\n\nThe drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary, not coerced,\nand does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V.\nThose convicted who are drug users, as evidenced by the test,\nare in need of treatment for their problem.  Institutionalization\nof these adddicted criminals is, I would argue, the best way to\nhelp them straighten out.  If they refuse the test and are convicted,\ntheir sentence can be appropriately harsher, since they, unlike the\naddict, have no \"excuse\" for their crimes.\n\n> |5.

My objective is to discourage drug use_and_criminal\nbehavior.  If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a\nharsher sentence if they are convicted, why is that not a good\nthing?  If fewer drug dealers (who are still criminals, BTW)\ncan find victims, why is that not a good thing?  If fewer drug\nusers, such as drunks, 'potheads,' etc., commit crimes out of\nfear of being cut off from their sources of supply, why is that\nnot a good thing?\n\nI'm certainly willing to debate my position.\nYou have to read it carefully though.\n\n--Standard disclaimer-- \n*.x,*dna**************************************************************\n*(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg.      * Conservative libertarians     *\n* \\'  KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu    *      for Pro-Balance!         *\n*(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com**********************\n \"I find television very educating.

I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people\nwould hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million\nJews is good.  So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value\nas I've encountered in my life so far.\n\n>                       For example, if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area,\n> isn't it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act, even\n> though there conceivably might be some tail-end case that would justify it?\n\nWell, I think your example's poor.

Far from it.\nI am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be\nuniversally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many such\nthings. But there are some. As an example:\n\n(1) murder is morally incorrect\n\n(2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to\nanother is morally incorrect\n\netc.\n\nThe point is that any action which serves to promote a morally\nincorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the\nright to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of\nfreedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the\nmurder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a\nmorally incorrect action.\n\nIn the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow\ndefinition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has the\nright to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an\nenforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by\nthe first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the\ntarget of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as\nthe right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated\nagainst.\n\nI believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a\nterrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and\ninterpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything\nshort of such an effort would render us little more than trained\nmonkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without\npaying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in\nquestion.\n\nWould you disagree, Mr.Berson?\n\nHarry.\n"}

{"group": "talk.religion.misc", "text": "From: mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon)\nSubject: commandments I (the basics)\nOrganization: PANIX Public Access Unix, NYC\nLines: 205\n\nWhy should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)\nwant to find \"commandments\" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\nenough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\n\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\n\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\n\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\n\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\nevangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\n\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\n\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\n[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\n\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\nhow it was said: 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy.  But I\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\ndoes NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\nChristians.\n\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\neven (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don't\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\n\nLet's move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\n\"equivalent\" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\n\n\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\n\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\n\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\n\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\nour understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\n\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\n\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\n\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew's\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\nof the synoptic tradition?\n\nI'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into \nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]\n-- \nMichael L.

If provincial governments (as bad as some of them\nare; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the\nConservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible,\nthere is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important that\nit's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent\ninsurrection outside of the hockey rink.

Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having\na population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ...\nand in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes\nwith that population or larger.\n\nAnyways, the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those\nin the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis, sudden\ntransients in spending are unlikely.  In fact, the health allocation\nis one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so any\ntalk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border.\n\n>If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back, the\n>things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like\n>luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable.\n\nThis won't be overnight, and something like this would force Canada\nto have a system more like the French one ... but that's not a bad\nthing, and the change will be minimal (i.e., add copayments and\nfrustrate the socialists chanting \"Hey, it's *free*!\").\n\ngld\n--\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGary L.

Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably\nhas that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is\nan avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,\nnor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note\nthat the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what\nis the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad\nfor some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming\nthe unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?\nThis administration has only one thing in mind.

Translation of Ha'aretz article.\n\nRacism in the Knesset\n---------------------\n\nCoalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKs\nfrom _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin and\nhis friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arab\npublic and their representatives in the Knesset.  Although he did refuse\nto view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining the\ngovernment, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document\nof intentions which included a commitment to \"work towards a decrease in\nthe discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens\".  [Decrease WHAT?!?!\nBut posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does\nnot exist *at* *all*!  Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal].\n\nHowever, racism has not disappeared.  When the Knesset sat to consider\nwho would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MK\nfrom Hadash [the Communist party, one of the \"Arab\" parties - Yigal] on\nthe State Comptroller's Committee.  And oh, did that ever stir up a\nstorm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members\nfind it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house\ncommittees.  \"Security secrets\" are liable to fall into their hands...\n\nThis attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism,\nbeing so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds\nthat there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens\nof thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body\nwhich represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here of\npolitical discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but\nof racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposed\nwas that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar\nGojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member's\nparty which was considered unfit, but his race...\n\n[* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *]\n\nIt is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, a\npublic debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following\narticle:\n\n\nA TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE\n\nBy Gid'on Levi, Ha'aretz, July 26, 1992\n\nRevelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral\npart of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal\nwith them.  [Do you hear that, -----?  Please contact this Levi fellow\nand explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal].\nExcept that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's\nwindow dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.\n\nLast week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is\nfinding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more\nimportant committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less\ndifficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seemingly\ntwo entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same.\n\nThe 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its\nmembers are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least\non one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and\nparliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition\nendures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees\nof the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the\nExternal Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee.\nWorlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not \"to\ngive\" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller's\nCommittee.\n\nThe arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above\ncommittees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an\nArab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments, but\ntheir significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is not\nspending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over\ninformation from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther\nheadquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are\ncontinually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which\ncould safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish\nUnderground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from\nHadash.\n\nThe Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee\non Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK\nNawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister\nin an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even\na review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly\nleaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MK\nHashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at\nal-Najah?\n\nTheir non-participation [in important committees] and that of their\ncolleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the\nelected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough for\naddressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the\ngovernment and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and\nAbsorption Committee.  But they must not, for example, participate in\nthe process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or\nin the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case, they\nhave little part in that.\n\nLabor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about\nsome improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the\nState Comptroller's Committee.  Earlier, there had been a ridiculous\nattempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be,\nand thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies,\nbut it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional\nbacking for such a step.\n\nBut not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.  The\nnew Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set up\nsubcommittees aplenty for his committee.  Thus he will decide where it\nis permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not.  A solution\nsuch as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of\nthe committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets\nbeing leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from\nthe Knesset.\n\n[. . .]\n\nEnd Article\n\nDo you accept that as documentation?\n\nJoseph Askew\n\n-- \nJoseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades,\njaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief.\nDisclaimer?

Although the administrative \nmechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical \nexample of a pluralist social order.'

Sousa writes of the \nexistence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to \nthe Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the \nOrthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were \nremnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians \nattached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian \nCatholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics \nattached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian \nCatholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) \nNestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure \noutlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman \nEmpire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2] \n\n[1] N.

Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old.\"\n\np. 118.\n\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed.\"\n\np. 192.\n\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered\n into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores\n that had been left by the Turks.\"\n\np. 193.\n\n\"Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks.

They had been as helpless\n and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the\n heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,\n and exchanging blow for blow.

Some,\n mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death.

AIRPORT\n\n    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon\n    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI\n    interrogation.\n\nBy Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer\n\nSan Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the\nPhilippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law\nenforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation\nLeague was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police\nsaid Friday.\n\nThomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after\nthe FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday\nnight after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard\nwas returning home.\n\nGerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday\nmorning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count\neach of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.\n\nIf convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and\n$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police\nargued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. \nA friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a\nsheriff's spokeswoman said.\n\nGerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,\nwith whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and \"wanted to have\nhis day in court,\" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and\none of two arresting officers.\n\nGerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from\n1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett\nsaid.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to\ndisclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he\nwas indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.\n\nGerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network\noperated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil\nrights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave\ncriminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said\nhe has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.\n\nInvestigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's\nhome computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950\ngroups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized\nunder search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los\nAngeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.\n\nGerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,\nJames Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the\ninterview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged\nsnooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any\ncriminal wrongdoing.\n\nBullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling\nintelligence to South Africa.\n\nADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent\ncontractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal\nactivity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest\n\"has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on\nthe case.\"\n\nArab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,\naccording to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to\npursue the investigation.\n\n\"We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly\ndisclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement,\" said\nJames Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.\n\nPolice, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the\ninquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A\nformer police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited\nGerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.\n\n\"I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but\nwe didn't think it would happen this quickly,\" Capt. Willett said. \n\"This development really speeds up our timetable on the case.\"\n\nDuring his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly\nregarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence\ndivision.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.\n\nAfter FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement\nand fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of\nManila.\n\nGerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines\nAirlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard\nafter his six-month hiatus, police said.\n\n\"He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked\nlook on his face,\" Willett said.  \"Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'\"\n \n--\nYigal Arens\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\narens@isi.edu\n"}

Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon\n>whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic\n>nuclei.\n\n\tAnd you've just described any civilian reactor because your\ndefinition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors\nblow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes\nfrom fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See\nwhat a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just\nnorth of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the\nsodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision\nreactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the\nPRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor\nitself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can\nbe made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is\nflawed in a few respects already.\n\n>  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses \n>in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause \n>death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of\n>people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or\n>cropland.  \n\n\tTyphoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If\nyou don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this\nbill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of\nspreading the virus.  Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits\nthis definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild.\n\n>Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous\n>gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there\n>is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for\n>research purposes on such chemicals.\n\n\tAnd I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example,\nperhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide\nis a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can\nbe used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for\nmaking carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a\ntoilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that\nit can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance.\nSo, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I\nstill have those pesky gophers.\n\n>I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for \n>definitions.\n\n\tThe basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not\nin writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and\nextended beyond the point where it does any good.\n\n>>I'll give\n>>you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the\n>>road?  In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction, \n\n>Nope.  It is not considered a weapon.\n\n\tIt is under your proposed law.  So is a silage pit if there\nis run-off.  So are underground fuel tanks.\n\n>>biological in\n>>nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate\n>>the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.  So,\n>>where do *you* draw the line?  In the USA, the EPA has ruled that\n>>a pile of scrap iron is illegal.  Care to draw a thinner line this time?\n\n>It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are\n>banned for other reasons.\n\n\tIt meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that\ncan be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose,\nand despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers\nsupply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass\ndestruction is rather a given.\n\n\tIt's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not\nsee a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly\nimpossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some\npretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for\nabuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old\nstandby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to\nbe added to, generally without going through the hassles of another\nvote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse.\n\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

It can be easily inferred \nfrom the facts on the ground and from the information \nprovided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, \nthough. The torrents of claptrap about \"the peace \nprocess\" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official \npronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. \nBy concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent \nthat Labour's policies were no different from those of \nShamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their \nmore effective implementation.\n\nLikud's policies were accurately described by Ariel \nSharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot \nAharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a \ndivision of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip \ninto four, \"autonomous\" Palestinian enclaves, all of them \nunder Israeli supervision. The total area of these \nenclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the \nterritories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli \nsettlements and the highways built around the enclaves. \nThe entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of \nRamallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already \nbeen turned into a \"Greater Jerusalem\" where the Arab-\ninhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded \nby areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for \nthem.\n\nJudging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be \nassumed that it may content itself with a lesser number \nof Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had \nplanned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by \nsettlements strategically dispersed along the highways \nremains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in \nthe West Bank: two in \"Samaria\" and two in \"Judea\" (i.e. \nnorth and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more \nthan two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to \"Greater \nJerusalem\", Labour's policies hardly deviate from \nSharon's.\n\nA saner version of Likud policy\n\nAs some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour \npolicies were but a saner version of Sharon's \nextravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot \nAharonot that, while \"barely a few months ago\" Labour \nsupported the demand to freeze all construction beyond \nthe Green Line, \"no specific decision to freeze \nconstruction in the territories has been taken\". And Uzi \nBenziman wrote in Ha'aretz that \"as far as can be judged \non the basis of the internal political discussions in \nJerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways\".\n\nThe two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are \nlocated in \"Samaria\". Therefore the belt of settlements \naround the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", designed to \nseparate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount \nimportance. According to the latest data, the percentage \nof Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population \n(apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But \nfor the area around the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", the \ncorresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is \nincreasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of \nthe \"Efrat Block\" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever \nthe enclave around Bethlehem from the one around \nHebron, is pretty much the same. The \"Efrat Block\" is now \nbeing connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.\n\nThe project is costly in the extreme, because the highway \nis designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long \ntunnels. The final decision to build this highway was \nsuspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in \nMarch. The subsequent decision to renew its construction \ncan be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a \nwhole.\n\nProcess of impoverishment\n\nThe enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady \nimpoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known \nin Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be \nconcerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, \nthe whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in \nHa'aretz in March. He mentions having seen \"a pamphlet \nissued six years ago by the Civil Administration \nforecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli \nrule in 2000\". His analysis deserves to be quoted \nextensively:\n\n\"We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its \nquality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to \nsteal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found \nthere more and more settlements, as if we deliberately \nwant to make the inhabitants despair, and in their \ndespair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is \nby our own doing that the Strip's workers must now \nspend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time \nas they spend working. From the military point of view, \nwe have kept control of no more than half the Strip's \narea at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and \nresources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the \ndefence ministry, I heard him saying that we should \nwithdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument \nwas that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and \ndeeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak \nShamir but he rejected it.\" Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.\n\nEnormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can \nalso be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being \nimplemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by \nthe first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to \ndivide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim \nDavidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli \nthis enterprise is. \"The Qatif Block is now producing 40 \nper cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a \nsubstantial proportion of cut flowers.\" He also deals with \nthe subsidies the settlers receive, considerably \naugmented by the present government. Owing to them, \nhousing units are cheap. The present government does \nnot spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. \n\"Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage \nfor his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels \n($6,500).\"\n\nSuch data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the \nPalestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to \nwork in Israel. The economic motivations were explained \nby Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March:\n\n\"From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be \nsealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could \nbe barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate \ndata is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the \nlast two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving \ndaily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from \n80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease \nis not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel \nfrom Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of \ndemand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment \nin Israel soaring and the construction of apartments \nblocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no \nlonger really needed...\"\n\nGaza's total dependence\n\nThe entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent \non Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has \nbeen an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli \nfactories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of \nsmall workshops, employing an average of four workers, \nget their raw materials or unfinished products, together \nwith detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. \nRubinstein attributes this development to the fact that \n\"the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent \nof that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the \naverage wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer \ndoes not pay any social security for his employees.\" If \nthe average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that \nin Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of \nPalestinian sub-contractors must be vast.\n\nThey are higher still when \"a Gazan sub-contractor \nprovides labour to be performed at home, with the \nfamily's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of \nGazans depends on such sub-contracted work.\" Many of \nthem are women and children, paid about ten shekels \n($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can \nbe no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan \nlabour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition \nof Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from \nthe Strip.\n\nEconomic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from \nwhat was created straight after Israel's conquest [in \n1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the \ntalk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures \nintended to \"encourage economic development in the \nterritories\", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits \nfor opening new businesses depend on a prior approval \nby the Shin Bet. \"Behind all the professed goodwill there \nis no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good \ncolonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the \nnatives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not \nbecome rebellious, and never do anything against the \ninterests of the metropolis, its economic interests \nincluded,\" wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The \ndevelopment of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip \naccords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis.\n\nSela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. \n\"In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in \nmotion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from \nthe threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is \nsimplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds \nin persuading the government, or even the trade and \nindustry minister alone, a military order is issued \nprohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this \ndoes not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a \nlicence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse \nits production.\" Among the most active of such lobbies is \nthe agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports \nof Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) \nnot only to Israel but also to Europe, where they \notherwise might compete with Israeli exports.\n\nPerpetuaring apartheid\n\nLabour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in \nthe territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which \notherwise could not support the Labour government so \nfirmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels \nhappier about supporting Labour than Likud is its \ngreater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This \npoint was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who \ndeplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to \nLikud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly \nsettlement growth \"occured during the term of office of \nthe National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which \nRabin served throughout as the defence minister\". \nLikud's reputation for settling the territories better than \nLabour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements \nwithout strategic value founded under Shamir for \nsymbolic reasons.\n\nTo sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by \nthe US differs from that of Likud primarily in the \nefficiency with which it is implemented. According to \nthat policy the territories are to be divided into two \nparts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, \nand the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist \nscheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying \nprice in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is \nrecognised, the less suffering it may cause.\n\n************************************\n\n\n"}

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\n\n The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real\n nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can\n be undone.\"\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

On what\nra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call \"orthodox?\"\n\n     \"Orthodox\" is a compound word. It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, \n     right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to \n     refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God \n     speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths \n     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.\n\nra> Who is that \"holds that\" Luke meant what you said he meant?\n\n     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are\n     pertinent.\n\n     Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on\n     an adjacent cross: \"Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in\n     paradise.\" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead\n     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until\n     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The\n     answer lies in the location of \"paradise\" when Jesus died.\n\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\n\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \n     Lazarus as \"Abraham's Bosom,\" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\n     \"Abraham's Bosom\" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\n     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.\n\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\n     the Father.\n\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: \"Ascending on high, He led captivity\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men.\" Verse 9 continues: \"But what does `He\n     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\n     earth?\" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: \"He who descended is the same\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens.\" Presumably He led the whole\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\n\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\nra> \"look at the Bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\n\n     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my 'personal \n     interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.\n\n     As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where\n     there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. \n\n     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one \n     views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff \n     that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can \n     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put \n     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to \n     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views\n     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.\n\nra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really\nra> understands it?\n\n     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is \n     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.

The Greeks started massacring \nthe Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into \nCyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is \nnothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention \nwas too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing \nnumerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been \nplanned for a peaceful minority.\n\nThe people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots \nwill never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain \neternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the \ncost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was \nthe sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops \non July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of \nArchibishop Makarios.\n\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\n'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\ndestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \nfor this irresponsible conduct.\n\nTurkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a\nrepeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If \nsuch assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason \nto expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate \ntheir past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find \nit satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before, \nfor it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical \nvicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation\nof two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another \narmed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily \nbut decisively terminated by the Turks. \n\nThe present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population \nin western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which \nwere established through international treaties. One might be better\nadvised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve \nGreece well.\n\nAn offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions \nthat may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for \nGreece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been \nplaced on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

Therefore, there do (did?)\nexist in ex-Yugoslavia \"Christian Muslims.\"  Tito defined the Muslim \nnation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,\nthe three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the\nend of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:\nMontenegrins, and Makedonijans. \n\nNations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, \"Muslim\"\nis much more a political term than a religious term (for those who \ndifferentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not \na \"Christo-Slavic\" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it\nwas the \"Atheist Communist\" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was\nno Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  \n\nThe war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a\ncivil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns\ninstead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all*\nchose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and\npeacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements. \n\n-Nick\n\n"}

But\nI strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\nin fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\nthemselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\nrelations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \nanything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\n\nTo say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\nthey are not separate peoples.  The events of the past two years\nclearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliance\nwith Croats, they maintained this separation.  Croats would have\naccepted a much closer relationship, I think.  This century plus\nof building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at\nrisk, because of the inexorable logic of war.  \n\nSince Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavy\nweapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined, they\nhave squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory.\nMuslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on).\n\nUnder these conditions, any alliance is bound to fall apart since\nit is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs.\nThe only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of\nfortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the\narms embargo.  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading\nthe Europeans to go along with this, this hope was dashed.  Having\nno prospect of outside help, the former allies turned on each other,\nlike two starved animals in a tight cage.\n\nThis inexorable logic, of course, got plenty of help from Serbian\nintelligence operatives, who were doing everything to build\nmistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year.  A timely\nintervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this.\n\nSadly, nothing was done to create a balance of power on the\nground.  As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage, they can \nbreak any alliance, even among friends.  This is tragic, but\nhardly new: \"divide et impera\" was used by ancient Romans\nwith success.  In my view, Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed\nto resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9, 1993,\nwhen the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost.  \n\nI have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do they\nbelieve Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder?  I'd like to know\nwhat did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which\nsolidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expect\nto prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces;  and how\non Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice?\n\nThe implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict,\nbut I am filled with foreboding...\n\nSincerely,\nJosip\n\n\n"}

Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the\n        Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991).\n\n pages 202-203:\n\n  <<In 1865, immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the\n  Jewish community, and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning\n  to have an effect in Istanbul, local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom\n  against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa, terminus\n  of the Anatolia railroad, with three hundred Jews massacred and many more\n  beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent\n  his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39].\n\n  In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly\n  by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and\n  other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European\n  consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\n  and homes.\n\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\n  little question or opposition.\n\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\n\n    ''Sir,\n\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\n      the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article,\n      he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course\n      this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40]\n\n  Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent\n  Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence\n  or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then\n  failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated\n  or led them.

The \neconomy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is \nin outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name \nof the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful \narticle in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty \nlinen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European \nCommunity. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics,\nGreece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and\nat times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  \nfeatherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community\nadmit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European\nCommunity.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that\nnotwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European\nin mentality and attitude. \n\nIndeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great \nsuccess with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, \nready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, \nsucceeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s.\n\nJust 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as \nTurkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed \nby far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are \nconcerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon.\n\nThe governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on \nthe infrastructure investments (rather than investing in\nworld terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue \ncompletely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question \nto conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. \nNowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote \ntown, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance \ncall to any given country.\n\nHowever, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact,\nit is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany\nround the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,\nthen your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not\nbe an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of \nGreece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece,\nby virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages\nof the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. \nTurkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports,\nhas nevertheless managed to create a better economy which \nenabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus\nover the last two years.

An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \nof the hills.\n\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \nor missing... \n\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \nrepeated blasts.\n\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis. They had been shot.\n\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY \nDECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

Elizabeth Bartley) writes:\n\n>I can certainly see opposing the \"Amen\" -- but that doesn't require \n>opposing a moment of silence.\n\nI already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause\nme to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a \"moment of\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\n\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\nChristian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \nbeing able taking note of it.)\n\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\n\"mainstream\" religion.\n\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\ndoesn't NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\n\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\non non-Christians.\n\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\nthe world to do so.\n\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\nsilence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment\nwill only embarrass you.  Give it up.\n-- \nMichael L.

On a couple of occasions on\nthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he\nmade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in\ndispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled\nand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying\nthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and\nlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to\nreconquer them today.\n\nI was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew\nwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found\nsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent\nmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my\nfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi\nand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is\nso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My\nfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,\nbecause, my father said, Anthony Lewis \"is always talking about\nthe Muslims.\"\n\nUpdate--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around\nSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and\nthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton\nadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the\ncollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.\nPreviously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds\nthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces\nbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers\nwent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention\nto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The\ncurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West\nand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to\nhalt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that\nLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly\ncalls for strong action.\n\nCLINTON AND BOSNIA\n\nIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department\nofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made\nnews when he resigned from the State Department because of the\nBush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian\naggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to\nthe president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by\ngetting involved there.\n\nApparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.\nClinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did\nabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has\nso far been the same.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton\nadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March\nreport by its own experts which called for military action if\nnecessary to protect \"safe havens\" for the Muslims. At one point,\nSenate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the\nreport was kept from Congress, that he called for an\ninvestigation.\n\nInstead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled\nagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what\nthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been\nsignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish\noff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other\nway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would\nNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this\nissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could\nnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better\nwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and\nthe destruction might have been curtailed..\n\nThe Nation, the left and \"the Bosnian QUANDARY\"\n\nTypical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core\nissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying\nhundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the \"Bosnian\nquandary\" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes\nto do nothing, even while noticing \"the ghastly atrocities of the\nBosnian Serbs\"  and that the \"greater and lesser powers...dither\nand fuss [and] hang back.\" (\"Before anything else happens, the\nClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United\nStates owes the\" U.N. the editorial concludes.)\n\nIn its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that\n\"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side\nof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World\nWar II.\"  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the\nBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients\nincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and\nothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher\nHitchens correctly called this editorial, \"contemptible.\")\n\n***\n\nWilliam Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The\nNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal\ncolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly\nand consistently called for strong Western and American\nintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column\n(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled \"International\nCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.\"\n\nHe clarifies the international failure which has led to present\nsituation in one sentence. \"Having refused to intervene to\nsanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent\nCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military\naggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious\n\"ethnic cleansing\" which followed that, the United Nations now\ncontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which\ntwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since\nexperienced.\"  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged\ncall for a \"more daunting and open-ended military assignment than\na direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have\nbeen a year ago.\"\n\nAryeh Neier on the Serbs In his \"Watching Rights\" column in the\nThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the\nmotivation of the \"aggressors\"--the preferred term for the Serbian\nforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than\na year.  He explains that \"there is no  military purpose that is\nserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above\nall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would\nwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are\nnot city people.\n\n\"It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of\nBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at\nany price--that explains the conduct of the siege of\nSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and\ncosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.\n\n\"Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil\nservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,\nmade up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The\ndestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility\nagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The\ndemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war\nexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred\nfor all that is cosmopolitan.\"\n\nThe light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is\nat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,\nfundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,\ncosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking\nthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the\nbeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained\nby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a\nthreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.\n\nNeier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to\nsecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the\nSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic\nidea.\n\nAnthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does\nrespect for Clinton's presidency \"depend...on his acting\neffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to\ndo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values\nwe and our allies profess.\"  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely\na betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us\nby proxy, just as Hitler was.\n\nOne argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a\ndifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for\nEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;\nthat is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been\nthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the\nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities\nresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.\n\nOne of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though\nthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to\nthe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will\ninevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a\nwhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.\nAnd as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we\ndo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.\n\nSincerely, Ronald Bleier\n\n"}

He read\nstraight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he\nlacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy\nread, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The\nfirst guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\nthat they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n\nThe other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a\nfairy-tale teller's voice.

Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.\nWhat made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\ncontained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\nthen that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,\nbut if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've\nread too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks\nabout in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your\nfriends_ in _Prometheus rising_. \n\nIt was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding\nthe actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to\nbe a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more\ndistance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain\npower and admiration.

If I apply for the Law of\nReturn, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my\nfamily was expelled about 2000 years ago?\n2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?\n3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been \nexpelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I \napply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I \napply as someone whose mother is Jewish?\n4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?\n5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted\nto loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?\n6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in\nIsrael, how do I do it?\n7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to\nIsrael, to convert to Islam?\n\n\nNow, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country\ndo not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.\nSuppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place \nwhich now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as\nwell as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.\nNow suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the\nfighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among \npeople he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same\ngod. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. \nAnd, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created\nwhere my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.\nAnd, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And\nthat people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and\ngranted full-citizenship.\nShould I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as\n20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and\nask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000\nyears?\n\nThen, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.\nI am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in \nZionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.\nHow would those who are Zionist define a Jew? \n\n\n\n\n>\n>>     Eric S.

Maybe\nthat's where you got the 2.5 million number.  Also, the number cited\nin the actual report is 1.5% so that would be about 3.75 million.\n\nAs for this march on Washington, I wonder how much the media is\ngoing to inflate the numbers this time.

Just a simple question.\n\n...with a simple answer!\n\n[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox\n[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \n\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\nApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians \nin Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  \n\n[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia\n[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.\n\nThis is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \nsociety.\n\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \n[EE] consciousness.\n\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \n\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\n\nYou answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry\nwas the word Armenian!\n\n[EE] Regards,\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\nS.D.P.A.

The following are quotes of his speech: \n\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \nof Kuwait.'' \n\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \nafter Kuwait itself.'' \n\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's \nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' \n\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \n\n\nOrigins of Kuwait \n\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means \nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \nestablishment. \n\nThe 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait \nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. \n\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart \nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \n1750-1800. pub.1965. \n\nAl-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well \ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the \nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy \nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \nGulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) \n\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \ntried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \nGulf area. \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait \n\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \n\nAbdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \n\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \nwar against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \nthose who had signed it. \n\n\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \n\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \nUniversity, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \n\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \n\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on \nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \nterritory. \n\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \nfather's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \nentitled to receive. \n\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \nhim the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's \ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.'' \n\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \nexplained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman \nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been \nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' \nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' \nThis description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain \ndegree it was run according to protocol. \n\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' \nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \nCazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \narmy.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \n\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but \nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \n\nAfter Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \nTherefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any \nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \n\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the \nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \nsought refuge in Kuwait. \n\nProtection of refugees seeking political \nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence \nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \nneighbors. \n\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \n\nAs to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

The press \nplane will leave from Washington. \n\t     \n\t     He will meet with some --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of a plane is that he's taking?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That he's taking?  He'll probably take a C-\n20.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  From Hagerstown?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  From Hagerstown.  Air Force One doesn't fly \nout of Hagerstown, apparently.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How will the pool travel?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The pool will have to meet him ahead of \ntime.  So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait \nfor him at the airport.  There is currently no provision -- and I'll \ndouble-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think \nthat's standard operating practice.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get \non the plane at Hagerstown?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What time does he have to be in Boston?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's going to meet there with a group of \ncitizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at \naround 1:30 p.m.  We're still working out the final times.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At the airport?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  \n\t     And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group \nthat authored something called Project 21.  The speech to the \npublishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And \nthen after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the \npublishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that's it \nfor the weekend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President seen the report from -- or the \nletter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, \nobviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is \nhis reaction to their call on him?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to \nSecretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the \nletter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on \nMonday to discuss their views.  He believes it's an important part of \nthe policy-making process and is taking their views into account as \nwe go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the President's reaction?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President hasn't seen the letter.  It \nwas something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In \nterms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of \ntheir concerns generally, what the President has said is that there \nare a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't \nthere before.  And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned \nabout the situation in Bosnia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel \nabout the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk \nofficers --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I \nthink that that is clearly part of the process.  It's something -- \ntheir views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary \nChristopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I \nthink he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that \nthose opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who \nwork closely on the issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What do you mean, there are options on the table \nthat weren't there before?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that \nthere were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian \nMuslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being \nconsidered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine \nAlbright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action \nby the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- \nany conversations that would have happened between Ambassador \nAlbright and the President.  But I think the President has said he \nwould certainly -- is working with our European allies.  He's had a \nnumber of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build \nsome consensus there.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything \nspecific to say today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new \nannouncement of policy today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does your statement mean he has ruled out \nunilateral action?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies \nat this point.  He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about \nit, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with \nits allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, does he believe that the U.S., \nthough, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already \nto take unilateral action?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes \nit clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian \nrelief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any \noptions that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is \nconsistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our \nallies to make sure that we get it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as \ndistinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done \nto stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that that's why we're considering \nadditional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday \nwere quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The \nPresident is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President \nClinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to \nisolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we're considering \nother options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's \nnot enough.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of what you were just talking about, it \nsounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to \nprotect humanitarian --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word \njustify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting \nthe delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that's just an \nexplanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will \nbe consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to \nmake sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The President and other officials have ruled out \nunilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  You're declining to do \nthat this morning.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly \nthat he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which \nhas been said before explicitly.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't mean to imply a change in policy.  \nThe President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with \nour allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One other little question.  Did he know about this \nletter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  Secretary Christopher \n-- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President \nhas not seen it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met --\nsurely, he must have brought that up --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about \nit, but --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright \nrecommendation has been rejected, is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I didn't say that at all.  I said I \nwon't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or \ncommunications.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She's advocating unilateral action and you're \nsaying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine \nAlbright may or may not have recommended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and \nfrustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, \ndoes the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service \nofficers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to \nthat?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being \nconsidered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two \ndays later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing \nof their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater \ndetail the options that they had presented in the letter.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on --\nadditional pressure on him now from within his own administration to \nact regardless of what the allies may or may not do?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there's a broad policy \nreview underway now.  And the President and his advisors are \nconsidering a number of options, including some of those outlined in \nthe letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no \ndecisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a \nthrough review underway, and that their opinions are being very \nseriously considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking \nfor is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this \nbolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't \nneed right now?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute \nsubstantively to the debate.  It's important that all views be \nconsidered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he \nwants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and \nthis, I think in many ways, furthers that goal.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the \nPresident -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or \nsay that they were out of line?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary \nChristopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they \nhad an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is \nconclusive evidence that their views are welcome.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the policy review include what Madeleine \nAlbright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, \nwhich is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral \naction -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The unilateral option is on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've had two different --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't that a change, Dee Dee?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That would be a change of policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which \nhas been specifically ruled out.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.  \nI don't -- that is not --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about all options?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has \nbeen fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he \nhas said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are \non the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground \ntroops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the \nbeginning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. \ncan solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think \nthat there are a number of very complicated options on the table \nright now.  I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on \nspecific options that are being considered other than in the broad \ncategories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms \nembargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked \nabout in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The \noptions being presented and considered are very complicated.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Air strikes on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that's been fairly clearly \npointed out that that's something that's being discussed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said there was not going to be -- you said you \nwere not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is \non the table.  We're confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has \nsaid -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert \nwith the allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they \ndon't go along --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies \non this.  He's continuing to have discussions.  He's continuing to \npress them for further action.  And I think that's clear.  The \nconversation is ongoing.  We're going to continue to work with them \nto find the best possible solution and next step on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to \nconduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite \neffect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel \nthat their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid \nwould become vulnerable and the Bosnians --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I \nmean, I'm not sure who you're referring to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The British and the French.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, the British and French.  They've taken the \nposition that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized \nby any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the \nU.S. believe differently from that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with \nboth Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a \nthorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I \ndon't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions \nother than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as \nwe move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action.  \nAnd I think that process is ongoing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     the other day voted against any military \nintervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of \nthe line or does he does still hold out some possibility of \nunilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they \ndo not want to do anything.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  That's all I \ncan tell you at this point.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement \non Bosnia today in the press conference?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press \nconference.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the intention?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's an opportunity to take questions.  He \nmay have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, \nbut it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That \nwill not happen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening \nstatement is?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's sort of a general statement of where we \nare.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After the first hundred days, you mean?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's not a long statement.  I mean, this is \njust generally.  Don't look for any major policy pronouncements.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know what the opening statement is?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able \nto tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review.  \nBut the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not \nmeant to be.  It's just to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the \nopening statement is on.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take \nquestions, it's not completely resolved yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and \nthat the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, \nwould be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what's the \ndelay on that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think we meant to imply -- I think \nwe said it would happen soon.  I don't think we meant to imply with \nany certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I \ndon't anticipate that happening today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the delay?  Isn't this the perfect time to \nannounce an AIDS czar?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that it's a delay.  I think the \nprocess is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through \nthe necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed \nthe t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for \nthe Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why wasn't her \nappointment announced here?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I don't know if \nthere's a specific list; I'll have to check and see.  I think there \nare a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.  \nMany of them have long histories in intelligence or other government \nservice.  I think there's a broad variety of views across political \nspectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never \nmade a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, \nwhich is Admiral William Crowe.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American \npeople and many in the Senate rejected her for another government \njob?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that the American people \never had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected \nin the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the \nPresident believes she's a very competent person.  He's said that -- \nZoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on \nthe President's Foreign Intelligence --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said she never went up there for a hearing?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage \nover violating federal laws?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you \nsaid she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to \npoint out that she was never voted on by the Senate.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So you don't think that is any problem?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think there's any problem.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She has been appointed to this board, is that a \nfact?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need \nconfirmation to be a member of the --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  It's a presidential appointment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Usually, announcements are made here at the White \nHouse.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We didn't make an announcement.  People who \nasked were told who  the members of the board were.  We didn't make \nan official announcement.  If anybody's interested in that we can \ncertainly put out the list of names.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'd like to know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a  \nmatter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and \npresidential appointment regardless of their dimension?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, I'm happy to put \nthis out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't that the standard practice?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That was past practice.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I'm happy to put it out.  We'll put \nout a list of the members of the board today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get \nout of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is \nhasn't it been the practice in this administration for such \nannouncements to be made routinely?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we're \nhappy to put that out today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the board, what is her title, what is the \nsize of the board?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the \nboard.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, \nretired military personnel on the board that provide input into \nintelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that \nboard is Admiral William Crowe.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And did he recommend Baird?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the name of the board?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, PFIAB.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's her qualification -- that she had employed \nan illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) -- \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you \njust want to make a joke?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me phrase it another way.  Why shouldn't this \nappointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a \ncouple of months ago?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Because it's not.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's her experience in foreign intelligence?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  She's an experienced attorney, someone who \nthe President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think \npart of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not \neverybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that \nis not the board's mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the \nPresident as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He \nbelieves she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously \ntalented and has said that throughout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this just a figment of my overactive \nimagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think so.  On December 24th, when he \nannounced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he \nwould -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I \ndon't believe there's ever been any --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Earlier than that, during the transition.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't believe so.  It was announced, \nagain, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was \nannounced. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are members paid?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so, but I'll double-check.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the \ndiscrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the \nbodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it's the \nTexas Ranger reports.  \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the \nfederal information is coming from the site.

The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\n\n\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\n\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\n\t  brings the death penalty.  \n\n\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?\n\n\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\n\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\n\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\n\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\n\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\n\t  prostitutes.\n\n\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've\n\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\n\t  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.\n\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\n\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \n\n\t  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,\n\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\n\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\n\n\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\n\n\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\n\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\nlast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that\nthey've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious\ngatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers\noffering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who\ndare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\nSaud, like they're trying to in the long run.\n\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\nwant, Ilyess?\n\n--\nDave Bakken\n==>\"the President is doing a fine job, but the problem is we don't know what\n    to do with her husband.\" James Carville (Clinton campaign strategist),2/93\n==>\"Oh, please call Daddy.

This is an American officer on the \ngenocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between\n1914 and 1920, not a crook/idiot like yourself.\n\n\nSource: \"World Alive, A Personal Story\" by Robert Dunn. Crown Publishers, \nInc., New York (1952). \n(Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 \n million Muslim people)\n\np. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).\n\n 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'\n 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'\n 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'\n \"We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....\n 'I don't believe you,\" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The \n  man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. \n  I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and \n  went inside.\n\n The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for \n its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an \n iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black \n with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As \n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face \n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \n as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so \n I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  \n slashed genitals.\"\n\np. 363 (first paragraph). \n\n 'How many people lived there?'\n 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.\n 'Did you see any Turk officers?'\n 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'\n\n \"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - \n Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled\n so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \n laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\n Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would\n have been.\n\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last \n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \n looms, even spinning-wheels.\n\n 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must \n leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And \n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \n Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'\"\n\np. 354.\n\n\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\n high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\n but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust\n of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on\n Moslem villages.\"\n\np. 358.\n\n\"It will be three hours to take,\" Dro told me. We'd close in on three\n sides.\n\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" Merrimanov\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\n\"That is for morale,\" Dro put in. \"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\"\n\"Soldiers or civilians?\" I asked.\n\"There is no difference,\" said Dro. \"All are armed, in uniform or not.\"\n\"But the women and children?\"\n\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\"\n\np. 360.\n\n\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said \n Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\"\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble \n where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet \n had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between \n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \n dress.\n\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \n pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \n just below his neck, into the spine. \n\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was \n empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking \n colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.\"\n\np. 358.\n\n \"...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled\n  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, \n  Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -\n  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would \n  break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'\n  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...\n\n  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips\n  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache.

Sounds like a form of terrorism to me,\nand not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not also\nforget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely]\nkilled many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or\nwho cooperated with the British.  \n\tI'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but\nI'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they\nwere a bit screwed.\n"}

Artificial Intelligence Lab.\nLines: 131\nReply-To: oaf@zurich.ai.mit.edu\nNNTP-Posting-Host: klosters.ai.mit.edu\n\nIn the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with\npeople from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cults\noperate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave\nthe way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing\nwith cults and similar organizations.\n\nI include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of my\ncorrespondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makes\nthe text choppy - sorry about that.  I've tried to retain the\ninformation content.\n\nEllipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  A few of the comments\nin parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to\nunderstand.\n\nThese notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize.\n\nCheers(?),\nOded\n\n------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------\n\nI took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included\ncults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external\nreading too).\n\nWilliam Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of\n\"evil\" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what\nwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,\nand by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think\nthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced\n..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tHow cult psychology works...\n\t[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could \"own\" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left\nhim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces\nof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)\ncouldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered \"cultism.\"  It really\ndoes happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such\ncases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no\nmatter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]\n\n...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]\n\nI agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good\n(?)  reasons for news blackouts.\n\n>\tThe only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  \n>\tyesterday, those people would be alive today.\n\n ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh\nmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.\nHence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The \"logic\" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could \"save\" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing \"his\" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's\ncertainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.\n\n...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]\n\n    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from\nKoresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.\n\n    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd\nwant to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning\nboneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_\nplaying chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at\ncheckmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.\n\n...\n\nI don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you\ndeny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and\nthe rest of the gummint should exist at all. \n\n\t\t(the end)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t\t\t  Okay, have at it.\n\n"}

The conditions were\nwonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it's not relaxing all\nthe same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it's \ntorture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment \nin Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It's \npainful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break \ninto our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I've put all my\nefforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older \ndaughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter \nmedical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick \nfor a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my \nlife: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by \nmyself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done about\nit. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on \nFebruary 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable.\n\nOn February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends with\nmy oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, \"Where's Vika?\" I say,\n\"Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come back\ntomorrow.\" My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking\nand laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.\n\nThey left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to\nthe balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the\ncorner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of\npeople near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're\nshouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I\nask, \"Nufar, what's happened?\" He says, \"I don't know, I can't figure it out\neither.\" I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after\nthem, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the\nkids. \"Mamma,\" says Gayane, \"you'll never believe what's going on out there! \nIt's awful!\" Ira says, \"Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh! \nKarabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to \ndrive out the Armenians and slaughter them.\"\n\nI called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, \"Aunt Tamara, \ndon't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later.\" I \ncouldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about\nVika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!\n\n-Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was \nhappening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't \n50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear \neverything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading \nall the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on \nthe bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . .\n\n-Zinaida: It's called slaughter.\n\n-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they \nwere killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,\nas though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they \nstarted dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not \ndoing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob.\n\nIt was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you \ncouldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything\nso as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us\nwas the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be\ndone about it. Where in the world was our government?!\n\n-Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't\nhome. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday \nmorning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, \"Zin', you know they \nwent into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his \nfather and two sons.\" Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on \nthe first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!\n\nI saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting \"Slay the\nArmenians! Karabagh is ours!\" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the \nway I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, \"They beat our store\nmanager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an \nAzerbaijani.\" And I asked, \"Did they kill him?\" She says, \"No, he's in serious\ncondition.\" I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the\nmob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the \nlittle way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but \nthese weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened\nthat I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the \nground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my \neyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and\nthe mob surged toward him shouting, \"He's an Armenian, get him!\" He wore a \nblack coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They \ngrabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.\n\nI made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my \nthoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus \nand she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they \nhad all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't even\nfind the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the \nbus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So\nthis Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running\ntoward it yelling, \"Armenians out!\" And I see them take the Armenians and beat\nthem, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just \ncouldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.\nShe says, \"Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have to\nsee it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children \nwill know.\"\n\nGayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people\nbefore my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .\n\n-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't \nmake anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He\nwas 18 or 19 years old.\n\n-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, \nin a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an\nArmenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him \nright under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been \nmuch left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks\none person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a \nsimilarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black \ncoats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they\nall looked alike.\n\n-Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and \nhe cried \"Mamma!\" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful \nlot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, \nseveral people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but \nwhen that boy cried \"Mamma!\" I immediately started watching only him.\n\n-Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until\ntwelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.\nThey were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact\nthat by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven\no'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their\npositions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-\nsection again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From\nmorning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine\no'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in\nthe crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.\n\n-Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a \ncross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,\nevidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the\nAzerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started\ntheir pogrom.\n\n-Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his \nnationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. \"But what is your\nnationality?\" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, \"Ermeni,\nErmeni!\" And he says, \"What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live\nin Sumgait.\" \"Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait.\"\nAnyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a \nwoman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and \ntook the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and \nthen burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone \nran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later \nanother car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting \"Ermeni! \nErmeni!\" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't\nbeat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged \nfrom the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, \nacquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, \"Yes, \nthey burned them along with the car.\" About two hours later a whole wedding \nprocession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they \nwere Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, \nand they were immediately allowed through.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The\nwhole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.\n\n-Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard\nof our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-\nbrating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were\nbeing killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.\n\n-Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and \nfind out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her \ngirlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third \nfloor. Gaya came back and said, \"Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around\neight, after eight.\" You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:\nVika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. \nThen I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of \nour neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were \nthrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I \nstarted to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not \nhere, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: \"Mamma, \nnothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, \nthey'll look out for her.\"\n\nDiana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the\nbalcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then \nthey came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.\n\n-Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.\n\nDiana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees\nplanted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.\nAll the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot\nof Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families, \neither.\n\n-Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many \nof them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.\n\n-Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that \ntwo people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that \n. . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the \nbuzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our \ncourtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this \npoint we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the \nbedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the \nsecond and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I \nrealized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, \"Gaya, \nhide the gold.\" That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I \ndidn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting \ndark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it \nwas.\n\n-Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow \nstation to the Azerbaijani one.\n\n-Zinaida: And turned it up loud.\n\n-Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for \nus. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would\nwatch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was \nit. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were \nAzerbaijanis.\n\n-Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, \nand we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors\nsuggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on \nAzerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they \ntold us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armenians\nare afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding.\n\n-Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed \nthat the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the \nAzerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.\nWhen we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and\nlater, another one. \"Turn on the lights,\" they told us, \"please. Nothing will\nhappen. Be calm. Nothing will happen.\"\n\n-Zinaida: \"We won't allow them to come into your apartment.\"\n\n-Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.\n\n  -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for\nArmenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The\nAzerbaijanis were crying, saying, \"Can it be there is no God? How could\nthey raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,\nyou never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,\nor in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you \ndown the river?\" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but\nothers gave us away. They sold us down the river.\n\n-Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became \ncautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't \nwear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the \nAzerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, \notherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was\nnothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into \nGod knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.\n\n-Zinaida: And she told me, \"Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other \nroom. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're \nArmenians right away.\" But how could I go away and leave her there?!\n\n-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were \nthe only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were \nthe only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, \nwould fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone \ncrawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.\nWhen we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and \nwe would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around\nand saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, \"What \nnationality are you here?\"\n\n-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.\n\n-Gayane: \"What nationality are you?\" he's shouting. Well at first I was\nfrightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect \nAzerbaijani, \"You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.\nCan't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to \nmeet you face to face and look you in the eyes?\" He looks at me and tells the\npeople with him, \"Yes, Azerbaijanis live here.\" From below they tell him,\n\"Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians.\" And he asks me again,\n\"What nationality are you?\" I say, \"Can't you see?\" I started fuming. I could\nnot say anything else. \"You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all you\nwant, but that won't make us Armenians.\" I hear them breaking down our\ndoor, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, \"I don't have time to deal\nwith you, they're breaking down our door.\" 1 go to the door and ask, \"Who is\nit?\" They answer, \"Open up!\" I say, \"Wait, why are you breaking the door?\nWhat's going on? I'm opening up.\" We never locked the lower lock, it was\nbroken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. I\nsay wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken\ndown already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, \"What's going on?\nWhy are you breaking down our door?\"\n\n-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting, \n\"Why don't you open the door?\" And I say, \"Well you've already come in the \nbalcony.\" Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the\ndoor. Gaya cries out, \"Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!\" I ran to the door \nand forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: \n\"Diana, open the door!\" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting with\ntears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.\n\n-Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That \nguy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They \nput it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and \nslammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, \"Mamma,\nthey want to kill you!\" And then . . . then they started shouting, \"Give us \nyour passports.\" And Gaya says, \"What do you need passports for, we're \nAzerbaijanis.\"\n\n-Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying\neverything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, \nbecause at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be\nhonest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would \nsurvive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, \"What, don't \nyou understand anything?\" They started shouting, they were tremendously \nexcited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their \ngirls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why \nshouldn't they do the same to us? I said, \"Who's doing all that? Who is doing \nit? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'll\ncut my own face.\" \"Now you calm down,\" they tell me.\n\nZinaida: I told them, \"Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in \nKarabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we \nwith the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back to\nthem there? What've we got to do with this?\" I got confused. I had been\nsaying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though\nI were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me,\nwith a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, \"What pretty girls.\" He\nmeant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring \nthem that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad \nlooks.\n\n-Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, \"Young man, I don't have my \npassport here.\" He says, \"Let's have the passport, we won't believe you\nwithout your passport.\" And one of them started hurriedly searching for\ndocuments. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the \npicture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling\nand shouting, \"Passport! Passport!\" They all started yelling, there was so \nmuch noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. \nSuddenly I said, \"Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a \nMuslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, \nyou've disgraced your honor.\" And then Mamma started to cry.\n\n-Zinaida: I started crying: \"My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed,\naren't you ashamed of yourselves!\" In fact my husband had died seven years\nearlier, in 1981. \"We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-\nments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension.\"\nWell it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, \"They're Lezgins.\nCan't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave.\" Another fellow in\nthe group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third\nsaid, \"No, they're Armenians.\" Well the other two convinced him, I don t know \nhow, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of \nthem, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was \nfilled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins.\" They started\nleaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had \nfirst called us Lezgins says, \"Leave that, what are you doing?\" They seemed to\nobey that guy.\n\n-Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.\n\n-Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.\n\n-Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he \nwasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands.\n\n-Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.\n\n-Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed \nfamiliar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't \nremember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he \nwouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and \nthat they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They\ncontinued to argue on their way out. Some said, \"They're Armenians all the \nsame.\" And that fellow answered, \"even if they are Armenians, it's shameful,\nthe father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, \nthere's no men. We should stay out of the apartment.\" \"What do you mean, stay \nout? We can go in there!\" And he said, \"No, we should stay out, they're \nLezgins, we're leaving here.\" The three of them protected us.\n\n   -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the\ngrey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they\nwere all young really. The two of them defended us.\n\n-Diana: Three, three!\n\n-Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?\n\n-Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.\n\n-Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.\n\n-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When \nthey left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran \nback and said that they were going to kill us.\n\n-Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I\nclosed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, \"Take Diana and go\ninto the other room.\" My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the\ndoor. There was a guy there who said, \"Run, hide! They're coming to kill you \nnow!\" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,\nAzerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. \nI was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything \nto take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been \npreparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn't\nsee anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and \nDiana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, \"Should I close the door \nand leave everything like this?\" He says, \"What do you mean, door? Get out of \nhere, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?\" And I ran \nafter the children.\n\n-Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into \nour apartment and started shouting, \"Where are the Armenians?\" We were already\nat the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, \n\"Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what.\"\n\n-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,\nto go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved in\ntears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'm\nalready thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I \nstill believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my\nmind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with\npeople, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment \nwe were hiding asked the bandits, \"Where are those Armenians, the ones who \nwere at home? Where did they make off to?\" They told him they didn't know. \nThey asked him where he lived. He answered, \"Can't you see, on the third \nfloor.\" He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We\nheard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color \ntelevision off the balcony and it exploded.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought\nher around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the \ndoor to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling \nVika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts\nwere only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, \noffering tea.\n\n-Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are\nalive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and \nburning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us \nand said, \"How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some \nother woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your \nhusband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't \nhave been able to take it. I don't know what I would do.\" He of course \nwouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard \nthey were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth \nfloor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their \nthree children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed\nwith their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an\naxe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the \nhusband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning \nthings; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, \n\"Look at the naked Armenian!\" They were going to throw the poor woman into the\nfire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she \ncovered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. \nAll the neighbors saw and heard it . . .\n\n-Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing\nthere, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them \ninto her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she \nlives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina \nshowed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was \ncovered, riddled, with wounds.\n\n-Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one\no'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I\ndidn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, and\nthe neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be\nslain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about\nthem, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn\nto pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand I\nwould have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was\ngoing to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: \"Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of \nyou!\" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we \nheld on that way till morning.\n\nOn the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to\nour apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go \nhimself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to\nme. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, \nstole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I \ndidn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far \naway, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my \nwork in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time \nbecause of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the\ntransport division -- and my trip sheets.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work \naround the clock to do her job.\n\n-Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about \nthe fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that\neverything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that\nlater, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the\nkitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and \nmy earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,\n\"Mamma, hurry.\" And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among \nthe debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her \ndresses.\n\n-Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started \nthrowing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto\nthe asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, \nwhen Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't \neat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies\nand gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day \nand everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my \nbooks, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take\ntwo cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own \ndresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there \nwasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one \nthat had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. \nI had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one \nwas yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a \nviolin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other \none were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy \nwith their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. \nThey were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the \nbedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my \nbirthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and \nthey disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of \nKarlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the \nother books were gone.\n\n-Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor\narrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and he\nthought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei \nSemyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw \nmy wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. \nWhen I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of \nthem were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my \ndocuments and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I \nremember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had \nreturned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? \nIncidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were\ngone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, \nthe neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. \"I'm afraid,\" he \nsaid, \"that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you\nand us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't \neven know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I \ndon't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere. \nWhere should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my \neyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, \"Go to Alik's, he's an\nAzerbaijani, too.\" and I say, \"You should have said that earlier, when my \nsupervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him.\" Everyone \nfeared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and \nstood. And he says, \"any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But \nright now, I'm sorry . . . \" Then another door opened, also on the third \nfloor. I ask the neighbor, \"Tayara, can we hide at your place?\" She's an \nAzerbaijani too. She says, \"What kind of question is that? Come in!\" She hid \nus. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the \nwardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the \nchild could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us \nout, and when they came back she would hide us again.\n\nWe sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed \nher to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or \ndrunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all \nof it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged \nhim to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be \nin the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put \nher passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came \nin she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to \nthe window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that \nsomeone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put \non a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was\na 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted \nthat someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on \nlooking.\n\n-Diana: I watched too.\n\n-Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers\ndidn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at\nthe soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended\nthemselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my\nchildren. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to\nstop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their\nshoes . . .\n\n-Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned \noff the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block \n36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.\nThe mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob\nsurged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several \nAzerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they\ncracked open another's head . . .\n\n-Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's just\nwhat it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields\nand clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard.\n\n-Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, \nbut these?!\n\n-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They \nattacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's the\ntear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used \ngas on those jackals they all would have scattered.\n\n-Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since \nmorning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine \nstanding there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't \neven allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and \nthen the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were \nbunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their \nshields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.\nAnd those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile\ntanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, \"Our \nchildren have never seen war.\" I never even dreamed about it, there was no \nneed to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It\nwas truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their \nclubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were \ncovered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own \nclubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, \nthey couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. \nIt's comical . . .\n\n-Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?\n\n-Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during \nour Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored \npersonnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, \"Get away, it's going to blow!\" \nEveryone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The \nsoldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the \nbus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.\n\n-Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The \nbus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel \ncarriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over \nthree, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on \nour street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one \nof the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over\nseveral over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus\nploughed into a book kiosk.\n\n-Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight \ninto it.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the\nmiddle of the road and set it on fire.\n\n-Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and \ntake them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.\n\n-Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his \nwife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking \nfor the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they\nwere saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor \nTayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I \nwould remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we \ngo?\n\n-Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but \nshe was afraid.\n\n-Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at\nnight we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said \nthat a curfew had been imposed. He says, \"Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev \nannounced a curfew.\" And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of \nAzerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in \nKarabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there\nhadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were \nAzerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we \nlearned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard \nagain, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one \nArmenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one \nleft. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.\n\n-Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and\nfound two bandits. They asked her, \"What are you doing here\" Tayara answered, \n\"I came to take something for myself.\" \"Take all you want, they're gone now.\" \n\n-Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. \nShe said, \"What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,\nnothing remains of your entire apartment.\" In short, we calmed down, and the \ncrowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know \nwhat went on there.\n\n-Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:\nthey were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know \nthe city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,\nbut didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee \nthey asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.\n\n-Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.\n\n-Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City \nParty Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, \nwhen I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, \n\"Get your things together, they have sent buses for us.\" As it was we had been\ndressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.\n\n-Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive \nand well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe \nplace. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The \nGambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,\nwas killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the \ngirls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and \nthe girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he \nwas taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna \nVasilyevna, a Russian: \"Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck.\" She kissed \nDiana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be \ntaken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on \nanother one. It was pouring rain.\n\n-Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, \nand they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, \nmany of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the \nsoldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the\ntanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people \nand they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a \nmattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they\nwere fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were\nblowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in\nthe courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a \nstreet, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way \nwere run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already \ndark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up\nand said, \"Get your clothes on, let's go.\" Gaya was wearing slippers, and I \nhad on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my \nold dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora \nsweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the \nstreet. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved \ndress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one\nof the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to\nthe other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's\ntrousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.\n\n-Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.\nWe had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let\nus out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed \nguard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, \"Are \nthese all us? Armenians?\" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were\nso many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know \nthere were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never \nnoticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the \nKomsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and \nwell. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, \nafter all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was \njust gone. She didn't believe it completely.\n\n-Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When\nwe arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It\nwas the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each \nother and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew \nthat there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken \nwindows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said \nthat they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of \nthem; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and\nher son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in \nour microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard \nso many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my \npatience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came\nto me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a \nsafe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We \nwent downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard\nthe voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started\nbegging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to\ntalk me out of it: \"I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked \nafter her better than a brother does a sister.\" All the same I asked him to \nget her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a \nmeeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, \"Give \nme my son back!\", another yelled, \"Where is my daughter?!\", a third wanted her\nhusband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying \nanything.\n\n-Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, \"To\nRussia!\" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild \nrumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go \nto Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and \nthat he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with \nthem. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our \napartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of \nNasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special \nflights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One \nwoman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.\n\n-Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but \nthe pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no \ncircumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will\nanswer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and\ndaughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? \nSomeone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the \npeople that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live \nhere, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would like\nto stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be\nunited. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won't be scattered throughout \nthe Soviet Union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happen\nagain. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armenians\nto be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our \nhomeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an \napartment and getting jobs. So that our children can work for the good of \nArmenia. If we aren't able to, then let our children do it. And if it's \npossible, we'll work for the good of Armenia too. This is the land of our \nforefathers. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was \nonly later that people dispersed all over. Like a mother, the land here bore \nand reared us. It is our wife, and will protect us, too. I want but one thing:\nthat our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your \nchildren here, in Armenia, never see anything like it.\n\n  May 28, 1988\n  Yerevan\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Fante} \\endauthor\n\\date {April 20, 1993} \\enddate\n\\endtopmatter\n\nIn a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to\npull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 day\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\nassigning blame.\n\n\\\n\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\n{\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\n[Reno's] decision.''\n\n\\\n\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\nto show their might and just purpose.\n\n\\\n\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\n\n\\\n\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\n\n\\\n\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\nBranch Davidians.\n\n\\\n\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\nand a city block razed.\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\it This policy of no-knock\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures''] are not denied.\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\noindent Matthew L.

The Administration is \nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \non its government's commitment to reform.\n\n\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\n\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\n\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\n\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\n\n\nReview of COCOM\n\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\n\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\n\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \nother states.\n\n\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\n\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \nthis process.\n\n\nMultilateral Test Ban\n\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \nand that the two governments would consult with each other \naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \nmonths.    \n\n\nDetargeting\n\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \n\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\n\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \nlate May.\n\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\n\n\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\n\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \nreform in Russia and the other states.\n\n                           *    *    *\n\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \nstates.\n\n                               -30-\n\n\n"}

You don't not\nhave to believe in the \"religious\" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine\nJudaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of\nJudaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily\nremoving yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself\nJewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue\nthat I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of\ndissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by\nconverting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most\nopen nation.  We have no quotas!\n\nSo I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion\n(not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.

However, if Armenians invade the United States and force\nAmericans to either flee or become Armenians, it will not succeed. Similarly,\nthe Armenians of Karabakh are being forced by Azerbaijan to either become \nAzeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated. \n\nKarabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within\nthe Stalin-prepared borders of Azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and \neventually was invaded in 1991 by Azeri OMON and Soviet forces, resulting in \nthe northern third of this Armenian area being depopulated of Armenians. The \nArmenians have been fighting back ever since. \n\nClearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for Armenians, of let's say Glendale, \nCalifornia, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent\nGlendale. Similarly, the Azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at\nclaiming sovereignty over the land and people of Karabakh, who have lived\ncontinuously in Karabakh a thousand years before the first Central Asian \ninvaders ever stepped foot in the Caucasus. \n\n[IC] Should they get it? \n[IC] And should the UN enforce their will?\n[IC] And is it a simple, beautiful concept, indeed?\n\nYour analogy has broken down because you have switched positions of the victim\nand invader.

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in\nany Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word \"Rosicrucian\" in the \nname of the organization. I only claim having done some \"homework\" :-)\n\n     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems\ndifferent, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck,\nEnglish may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)\n\n     I proceed:\n>\n>I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at\n>least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday.\n>\n     Let's start with the name \"Rosicrucian\". I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\nsome 'rosicrucians' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\n\n     I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\n\n     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they\ndescend (at least in part) from what was the \"Gold-und-Rosenkreuz\" (Golden\nand Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two \"Golden and Rosy\nCross\", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with\nMasonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).\n\n     \"You'll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \n\n>The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\n>that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n>(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n>\n     Again, instead of R:s, it should be \"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\" :-). It\nis curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\nsectarian*.\n\n     The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged\nthe 'authority' of the medieval catholic church.

If a scientist creates a unique living creature\n#(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the\n#right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?\n\nDear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions,\nbut that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there\nare respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\nGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (\"I\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\n\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\n\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\n\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\n#\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They\nwill cry \"heresy\" and other accusations of \"perverting\" the doctrines of\nthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as\nfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)\n\nAs for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as\nexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea\nScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not\nleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.\n\n#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\n#\n#                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\n#                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there-\n#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\n#                        stabbing you in the back?\n#\n#                                                        -Voltaire\n\n\nCasper C.

I'm just getting started with this\ntype of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.\n\nComments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nEditor, \n\nI would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to\nthe \"right to keep and bear arms\", and to a greater degree, the many other\n\"rights\" that we take for granted on a daily basis. \n\n1.\tYou're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  You\ncall the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while\nyou are waiting for the police to arive? \n\n2.\tYou are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A \"good\nsamaritan\" stops to \"help\", when you find you and your family at gun-point or\nknife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? \n\n3.\tYou are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears\nsuddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you\nstrong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape\nyou in order to survive the attack? \n\nIf the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep\nand bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun\nmay not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going\nto let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to\ndefend yourself and your family? \n\nMany times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If\ncertain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm\nammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law\nenforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition\nfor use in your handgun. \n\nThere is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel\nthat any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for\nthe purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?\n\nOur local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,\nor in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while\nwaiting for help to arrive. \n\nThere is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit\nthe sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One\nelected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! \n\nI want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected\nofficials decided that they should only belong to a \"certain church\", or go to\nchurch on a \"partiular day\"?  What if you were told that you could only read\ncertain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the\nright to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful\nmanner? \n\nThese are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments.\nIf we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight\nfor the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your life\nis affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by\ndefending your Second Amendment rights. \n\n"}

Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,\nejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion\non these questions.\n   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,\nwhen it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.\n   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50\ndeputates (25 \"democrats\" and 25 \"partocrates\"). At that time \"democrats\" and\n\"partocrates\" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long \ntime and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,\nthe deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon\na session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out\nof the Parliament. --0--\n\n\nTHE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA\n\n    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement\nbetween Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign \nMinister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. \nThe group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of\nEconomics of Estonia.\n   The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,\nthe delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the\nrepublic.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE\n\n   Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid\nAhmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS\ncommon economic zone.\n   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a \ncommon tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. \nAccording to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for\nthe discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number\nof unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.\n   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the\nbackground of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of\nthe Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic\nzone.--0--\n\n\nTHE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW\n\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director\nof the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic\nalong with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to\nhold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. \nAccording to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.\n    As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent, \nprecise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other\nquestions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in\nMoscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling\nof industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.\n    When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end \nof May.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF\nMAY\n\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,\nTurkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the\npresident of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted\nthat the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.\n     \"Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by \ninsistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis\nof the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6\",- said\nGasimov.\n     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just\nbegan to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be \ngiven as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.\n     As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by\nArmenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--\n\n\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n   BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced\nthat the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers \ncondemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent\npeople is unjustified.\n    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,\nprove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units\nand with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they\nserved.\n    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers\nas ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also \nunfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the\nlist of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.\n   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of\nthe Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the\nRussian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this\ntype of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE\nSIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan\nis considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six\naccused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives\nof the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation\nto Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will\nbe directed to Russian parliament.\n     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give\nRussian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the\ninvestigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have\ngiven rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation\nin the war against Azerbaijan.\n\n\nARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE \"KARABAKHS\" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of \nArmenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies\non the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the\nnewspaper \"Russky vestnik\" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.\n     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the \ndocuments of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of \"reunion\" of\nthe North Caucasus and \"Armenia proper\" at present, the front is appealing to \nthe UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the\nneed to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.\n     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to\ncarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity \"identical to\nthose in Nagorno Karabakh\". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian\nnational-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of\nArmenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus \ninstructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.\n     Thus according to the newspaper \"Russky vestnik\", \"new Karabakhs\" are \nbeing planning on the North Caucasus. --O--\n\n\nSTATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of\nAzerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural\ncenters was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president\nElchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and\nculture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. \n     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a\nlegal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership\nof Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all \nnationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.\n     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,\nHidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the \"undeclared\nwar\" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many \nproblems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic\ngroups. \n     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of\nJustice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture \nand means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign\ndiplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of\nfree accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). \n     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted\nto create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of\nAzerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, \nradiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the\neducational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national\nteaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences\nof Azerbaijan.--O-- \n\n\nMEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State \nconcern \"Azerineft\", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies\n\"AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum\", \"Bi-Pi Exploration Operating\", \"Pennzoil\nCaspian\", \"Unocal Khazar Ltd.\", \"McDermott\" and Turkish oil corporation on\nmutual extracting of fields \"Azeri\", \"Chirag\" and \"Gyuneshli\" was signed. \nAccording to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common\nprogram of activity was created. \n     According to the president of \"Azerineft\", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation\nwill provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. \n     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of\noil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of\nexploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the\nexploitation of these fields. \nThe memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical\nand political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas\nfields. --O--\n\n\nARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on \nsix Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,\nArmenian propaganda has become actively involved.\n     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin\nwith a request \"to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian\nsoldiers\". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings\non the case in Baku as \"a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia\".\n     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could\nbelieve the Yerevan agency \"Snark\", the Armenians in Karabakh presented\nan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum\nis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in\nKarabakh will be shot dead.\n     It is simple to explain such \"touching attitude of Armenians\" to\nthe six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed\nit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused\nRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister\nof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.\n     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its\nsaving of lives of \"innocent Russians\". --O--\n\n\nNEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of\nAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan\nfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.\n     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,\nNyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from\nKafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were\ndestructions in the villages.\n     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,\nShynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of\nAzerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in\nprogress.\n     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of\nArmenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated\ninto the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two\nshepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a\nflock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--\n\n\n\"UNOCAL\" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the\nrepresentation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this\ncompany decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of\n50 houses for refugees.\n     At present, the American side suggested a village project for \nconsideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project\nis a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary\naccommodations and so on.\n     According to the program the construction and putting into\noperation of the village will be this year. --O--\n\n\nMANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the\nnational currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian\nRuble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.\nTaking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with \nrespect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value\n10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is\nthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.\n     According to the representatives of the business circles and\nexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles\nare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial\noperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics\nof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen\narrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business \nwith Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much \nRubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--\n\n\nTHE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY\n\n    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the\nexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and \npresidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before\nthe Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new\nConstitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of\nthe country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the\npress-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.\n    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and \nrepresentatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev\nand Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.\n    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary\nelection law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill\ndidn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative\nvariant of the election law was put forward.\n   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions\nwill examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all\nproposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--\n\n\nISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR \nCLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED\n\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the\nAzerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman\nof the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with\nthe conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant\nK. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the\nSupreme Court of Azerbaijan.\n   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan\nMilly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme\nSoviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal\ncase. In his view, \"the conclusion of the commission could help in the \nobjective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems\nin the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the\nknowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime\".\n   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,\nMilly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the\npermanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human\nrights and international relations are charged with the exploration of\nthis problem.--0--\n\n\nWILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?\n\n      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative\nto the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the \nTrilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with\nthe representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case\nthe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.\n     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors\nof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is\npaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from\nthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and\nUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial\nUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--\n\n\nFATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER\n\n   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,\nSabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of\noil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.\nAs it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-\nRAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian\nfields.\n   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete\ntreaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and\nPENNZOIL will sign treaties.\n   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645\nmillion ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton\non Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.\n   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to\nbring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net\neconomic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in\nthe defence of its interests at the international scene.\n   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement \"the May of\n1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its\nindependence and we have to stand these tests\".--0--\n\nTHE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan\ninforms, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.\nThe appeal contains the call \"to display mercy, humanism and clemency \non the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed\nForces\".\n   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the\nparticipation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,\ndon't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce\nthe mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the\nRussian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.\n    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'\nmothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the\npresident of Azerbaijan to \"save those guys\".\n   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,\ntaking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only\nRussian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down\nlives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made\nanswerable.\n    Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers\nof Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--\n\n\nARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of\nAzerbaijan were killed during the \"Grad\" shelling of the villages of\nKolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of\nthe republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.\n     The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of\nTovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire\nfrom the territory of Armenia. There are destructions. \n     The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated. \nOn May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the\nvillage of Ortakend. The transportation of man power and military equipment\nto this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is setting\nup a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by\nvillages.\n     According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentration\nof man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselsky\ndistrict of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on the\nfrontier with Fizuli district. --O--\n\n\nAZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN\n\n  BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,\nRauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that\n\"Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan\nafter Iran\". The business cooperation between the two countries\ndevelops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil\nextraction equipment, communication and agriculture.\n  According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of\nAzerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May\n23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will\nhelp, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch\noffices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude\ncontracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on\nbuilding in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the\nentire communication system of Azerbaijan.\n   In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain\nwill have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.\n   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great\nBritain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of\nthe economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--\n\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \n             T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y\n                     Baku - Azerbaijan      \n                Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833\n                    Fax: (8922) 66-2009\n                   Telex: 142168 META SU\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n                  \nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

I also have the writings\non Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how\nmuch he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and \nAristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus\nmakes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,\nthe id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus\nexplained it far better and gave reasons.\n\nThomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They\ncan screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these\nmen on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,\nhe thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.\n\nHere's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians\nthat \"that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is \nspiritually discerned.\"  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a\nclue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's\nincredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally\nbizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on\nmy part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,\nit is a truth, explainable or not.\n\nAre any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those\ndot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front\nof you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If\nyour eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals\nembedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand\nout from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,\nyou will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot\ntest appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.\n\nA normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a\ntotal anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.\nIt is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything\nthat to him is as plain as day.\n\nThat it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.\nThe believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns\nfit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the\nother hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks\nI am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and\nsay, \"No, you are weird.  You do not see.\"   Then it is time for a sanity\ncheck.  I go to another Christian and say, \"Do you see this.\"  And\nthey go, \"Yes.  It is an \"X\"\".  And I say, \"Thank God, I see the \"X\"\ntoo.\"\n\nIt is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to\nthe phrase, \n\n         \"He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.\"\n\n\nI am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.

As it turns \nout, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the \nsetting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently \nalso supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to \nensure the holding of democratic elections in the \nterritories.\"\n\nThus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily \nHadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the \nthinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this \nissue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the \nsettlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the \ndecision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian \npolice force as a significant step towards the instituting of \nreal autonomy, something which will restrict what can be \ndone by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza \nStrip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street \ntheater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian \npolice force', rightwing elements are attempting to \nfrighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go \nback on his decision. Members of the Kach movement \nhave even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the \nOccupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future \nPalestinian police force.\n\nHowever, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the \nnew police force - as far as the Israeli government is \nconcerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over \nwhom they will apparently have no authority, but will \ncontrol political groups within the Palestinian population, \nwhom the government is interested in neutralizing. \nWrites Barzilai:\n\n\"...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting \nup of a local police force in the territories will precede, \nnot only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of \nthe preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.\n\n\"The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a \nlocal Palestinian police force is evidence that the \ngovernment is serious about arriving at a settlement with \nthe Palestinians...\"\n\nIt's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly \nworried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is \ninevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal \nHusseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a \nvariety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would \nlike to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the \nPalestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his \nplans.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nAdd'l comment by E.D.:\nNumerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in \nco-opting some Palestinian\ncircles by this idea. They fear that a Palestinian police \nforce, controlled in fact by Israel, might act even more \nbrutally than the IDF. The idea of using a surrogate police \nforce is not new. It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was \nused by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Now his activities\nare at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent\nAmerican history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal\nindictment in San Francisco.\n\nOver a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876\nindividuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes,\nincluding the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian\nMovement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP,\nPalestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans\nfor Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who even\nspied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when\nhe visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on\nanti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile,\nbetween 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a\nprominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its\nfinancial relationship with Bullock.\n\nLast month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San\nFrancisco, as well as Bullock's home, confiscating computer files and\nboxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock's files\ncontained the driver's license and vehicle registration information,\nin addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was\nallegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, told\nthe FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base\nhad been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  \"Based on the\nevidence,\" says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, \"I believe\nthat Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them\nwith confidential criminal and DMV information.\"\n\nWhat's more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for\ntapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false\nidentities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from\nBullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area\ntrash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the\nChristic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message\nslips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers),\noffice correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the\nsenders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic\nInstitute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings,\nas well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the\ndates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic\nInstitute's checking account.\n\nInvestigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed\nthat the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material\nwith Israeli government officials.  What's more, Israel apparently used\ntips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there.\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nThe ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and\nlater other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fight\nagainst racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the\nAmerican Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights\nmovement.\n\nBut there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on\nleftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House\nCommittee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung\nsharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a\nbastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite\nwho heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger\nto Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists,\nblacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in\nAmerica, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his\nideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL's vast\nnetwork of informants, who were given code names like \"Scumbag,\"\n\"Ironside,\" and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta\n-- \"Flipper.\"\n\nFor years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community\nknew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targets\nwere anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon\nLarouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullock\ncase reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent,\nand progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civil\nliberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco,\nwhere the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possible\ncriminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an\nindictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says one\nsource close to the West Coast investigation, \"It is 99 per cent\ncertain that the ADL will be indicted.\"\n\nIn the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADL\nspying are spreading to other parts of the country.  \"We have received\nnumerous complaints about ADL [spying],\" says Sam Adams, a\nspokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland, Oregon.\n\nOn April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, and\nAfrican American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on,\nwrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting \"an immediate\ninvestigation\" of the ADL.  \"The ADL's actions cause great concern, as\nit is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil\nrights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San\nFrancisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism.\"\n\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office, says, \"We\nhave no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation.\"\nMcKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San\nFrancisco D.A.'s office on their pending investigation.  \"They have\nnot, so far, asked for our assistance.\"\n\nThe ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with\nlaw enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensive\nfiles on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page\npress release, \"The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news\nclips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents....\"\n\n\"ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance\nviolations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency,\nand the process by which the League gathers information is presently\nunder review to insure that no laws are being violated.\"\n\nThat's what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so low\nthat its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  And\neven as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show\nof solidarity, many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewish\nofficials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human\nrights group or a secret police agency.\n\n\"The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the\nJewish community as the definitive source of information on anti-\nSemitism and extremist groups,\" says Daniel Levitas, the former\nexecutive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-\nbased group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups.\n\"One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely\ntainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its\nobjectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the\nJewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous\nwith American Jewry.\"\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nBullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well\nwith the ADL's Cold War worldview.  In 1960, he moved to Southern\nCalifornia where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullock\nalmost always used his real name when snooping, although he once\ncalled himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of\nAlabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL's office in\nLos Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to Fact\nFinding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records.\nUnder Suall's stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become the\nADL's heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters across\nfrom the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast library\non \"hate groups,\" culling material from publications, speeches, and\ninformants reports.\n\nBullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long after\nmoving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John\nBirch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office.\nThere, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  The\ndiscovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that\nthey had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers.\n\nBullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups\nuntil the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by\nHarvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well.  A\nfew years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco\nwhere he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who had\ninfiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When the\nensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate\nthe Arabs.\n\nThe ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senator\nJames Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA's\ndirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullock\njoined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparently\ntrying to discredit it, according to published reports.\n\nIn 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of\nArab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to court\ndocuments, Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds.\nBullock was unable to \"follow the money.\"  But he did such a good job\nat ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA\ndelegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIt's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  But\nonly acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  As\nfar as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavily\ninfiltrated by what he called \"gay left revolutionaries,\" prompting\nhim to write about their activities for the ADL.\n\nBullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of\nforeign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL's San\nFrancisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard was\nthen a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's\nIntelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the\nCIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more\nthan a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searching\nGerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and\ninterrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as\npassports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including Thomas\nClouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines\nwhere he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he\nwill blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death\nsquads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.)\n\nAfter their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullock\nhad lunch at McDonald's, \"I liked Tom right off,\" Bullock later told a\nSan Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation\nwas obtained by the _Voice_.  \"Tom is a very charming, roguish\ncharacter, with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here, I\nconsider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked\nwith, absolutely.  Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent\nAmerican.\"\n\nBefore long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL\nreports on various groups and individuals.  In turn, Gerard gave\nBullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans,\nskinheads, and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material\nended up in his ADL reports.  \"I would say 99 percent of the data that\nI got was name, address, and sometimes physical description.  Criminal\nhistory, very rarely,\" Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gave\nBullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American\nbusinessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East\nterror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans\nreceiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customs\nin New York gave Gerard the photos.  \"It was understood that Bullock\nwould be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard\ngave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or\nother law enforcement officers,\" says an FBI report.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with law\nenforcement.  By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files with\nhundreds of \"official friends,\" the organization's euphemism for U.S.\nlaw enforcement and intelligence sources.  The ADL's relationship with\nthe FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports on\nArab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were \"must\nreading.\"\n\nIt's no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report\nentitled \"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--New\nYork Area\" while searching the ADL's San Francisco office.  In 1987,\nADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in\nCalifornia universities on student visas.  When the ADL discovered\nthey were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which in\nturn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nAfter the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADL\nregional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_\nabout his office's cooperation with law enforcement, although he's\nbackpedaling now.  The \"Los Angeles 8\" deportation is still under\nappeal.\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nWhile the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops, it enjoyed\nsimilar ties with Israel's spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders\nvehemently deny.  But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director Benjamin\nEpstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes,\nrequesting $25,000 for his investigators.  \"Our information,\" he\nboasted to Joftes, \"in addition to being essential for our own\noperations, has been of great value and service to both the United\nStates Department and the Israeli Government.  All data have been made\navailable to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are\nthe source.\"\n\nIn 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard\nspy scandal.  While assigned to the Navy's Anti-Terrorist Alert\nCenter, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets,\nJonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for\nIsrael, which, according to federal prosecutors, \"could fill a room\nthe size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet.\"\nPollard's handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whose\nwife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.  Pollard later wrote to\nfriends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli\nspy operation.\n\nWhile there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was\ninvolved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passes\ninformation to Israeli intelligence.  In March 1993, the FBI\ninterrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until\n1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police\ninformation to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\nThe FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information\nto Israel.  Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law\nenforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of a\nradical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San Francisco\nInternational Airport en route to Haifa.  Gurvitz phoned the deputy\nIsraeli consul general in L.A. with the information.  \"Later the same\nday,\" according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the\n_Voice_, \"Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from\nthe Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information\nabout Elias.  Gurvitz did not get this man's name, but their\nconversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was\nactually an Israeli Consulate official.\"\n\nAmong the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL\nfiles in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicago\nresident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedly\ndistributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the large\nIslamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories.  The\nChicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work\nwith \"official friends\" in local law enforcement, according to\ndocuments released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to the\nADL.  Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has\npassed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence.\n\nOne technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American\ncommunity in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral\nnotices.  According to sources familiar with the practice, ADL\ninvestigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals,\nwhich sometimes turned into PLO rallies.  Palestinians have been\ndetained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been\nfilmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, the\nexecutive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was an\nArab member of Israel's Knesset.\n\nShortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announced\nthat Hamas was being run from America with money and operational\ninstructions relayed by courier or fax.  Israel's charges were played\nup on the front page of _The New York Times_.  According to well-\nplaced sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, worked\nclosely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification,\nintroducing \"friendly\" reporters to \"official friends\" in Chicago law\nenforcement.\n\nBarsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about how\nHamas is funded in America.  She identified the Dallas-based Islamic\nassociation for Palestine in North America as the front organization\nfor Hamas in the U.S.A.  \"Its infrastructure functions as an\ninterlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and\nindividual activists,\" says the February 1993 ADL report, which\noutlines the organization's development, its activities on U.S.\ncollege campuses, and its \"metamorphosis\" during the Gulf War. It\nalso traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front-\ngroups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California.  It is\ndoubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data\nwithout the help of \"official friends\" and ADL spies.\n\nBarsky refused to comment.  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as\nmany as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for\nAIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_.\n\"The level of cooperation was very close,\" Slabodkin said during a\nrecent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school.\n\"If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL.\"\n\nWhen Sha'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in\nthe Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in\n1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entire\npolice file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy.  Jabarin\nhad been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed to\nbeing a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured.\nJabarin, who received a short jail term, became an Amnesty\nInternational Prisoner of Conscience.  Of course, to AIPAC and the\nADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.  Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs\non him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called a\nrepresentative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group that\nemployed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary.  AIPAC even opened a file\non musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebok\naward.\n\nWhile the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of\nArabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder\ntime explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\nDavid Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact\nfinder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulged\nwith information about the Israel-South African connection and anti-\napartheid groups.  \"Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely\ncollect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in\nthe United States,\" says the FBI report.  While Gurvitz said there\nwere files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimated\nthe oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the\nlate 1970s, paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and a\ndeepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. \"In\nabout August, 1992,\" says the report of the FBI's March 3, 1993,\ninterview with Gurvitz, \"an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at\nthe South African Consulate in Los Angeles.  Participating in the\ndemonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist\nWorkers Party.  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,\nand a subsequent demonstration.  He wrote a report for the ADL on each\nof the planning sessions and on the demonstration.  Copies of the\nreports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the San\nFrancisco ADL office.\"\n\nIn 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African\nConsulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting\norganized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby.\n\"Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is,\"\nsays the FBI report, \"Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want\nto warn the South Africans.  Gerard agreed and informed the Consul\nGeneral, who canceled his appearance.\"\n\nA few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African\nintelligence officer wanted to meet them.  During a rendezvous in a\nhotel near Fisherman's Wharf, the South African said he was interested\nin acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists.  The\nSouth African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked for\ninformation about groups that were advocating divestments.  \"Gerard,\nwho was present throughout the meeting,\" says the FBI report, \"told\nHumphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphries\noffered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information.\nBullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted\nwas already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL.\"\n\nBetween 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South African\nintelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with\nGerard.  \"Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard never\nexplicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may have\nbeen telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the South\nAfricans,\" says the FBI report.  \"Gerard had said he knew the CIA\n'resident agent' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard dropped\nBullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie [who\nreplaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to go\nto the San Francisco CIA office.\"\n\nAl the while, Gerard may have been \"tasking\" Bullock for the CIA.\n\"Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went to\nChicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL,\"\nsays the FBI report.  \"The target of the investigation was a group\ncalled the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.  Bullock learned that a\nwoman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or the\nPFLP, and the United States.  Bullock told this to Gerard.  Gerard\nlater told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to know\nmore.  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to\ngather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.\nBullock, however, never did go back.\"\n\nGerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, which\nmay have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel.  The\nADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials\nto Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts\nin various intelligence agencies.  According to an affidavit by San\nFrancisco police inspector Roth, the \"all-expense paid trip [to\nIsrael] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the\nADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law\nenforcement officers from the United States.\"\n\nGerard may have liked what he saw in Israel.  A short time after\ntravelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's\nrescue of Ethiopian Jews.\n\nAs Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked more\nopenly about his exploits in the CIA.  \"Bullock recalled Gerard\nmentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and that\nGerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses,'\" says the FBI report, \"To\nthis Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined\nthat the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating.\nGerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan....\nLouie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside South\nAfrica as an intelligence officer.  Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war\nstories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow\nscrapes.'\"\n\nAlthough there is still much mystery about what triggered law\nenforcement's investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft of\na classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's San\nFrancisco office.  Police armed with search warrants recovered the\nreport in the ADL San Francisco office.  Gurvitz says he had sent a\ncopy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL's fact finding\ndivision in Washington, D.C.  Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for\n_The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islam\nshould not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A.\nbecause the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone.  (Boland, who\nhad arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard,\ntestified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she had\nworked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the\nDefense Department before joining the ADL.  During the trial, Boland\nadmitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation-\nonly ADL conference.)\n\nAfter he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to the\nPhilippines, which has no extradition treaty with America.  Gerard is\nbelieved to have supplied information from police computers not only\nto the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well.  The _San\nFrancisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating\nfederal espionage laws.\n\nAlthough Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suall\npraised him in a July 1992 memo as \"our number one investigator,\" the\nADL now argues that he was a rogue agent.  In its own defense, the ADL\nalso asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than\njournalists.  After all, ask ADL officials, don't journalists keep\nfiles?\n\nBut the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's\nmethod of gathering information couldn't be more striking.\nJournalists place information in the public domain where they are held\naccountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel.  And for the most\npart, journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign\nand domestic police agencies.  The ADL has no such inhibition.\nBecause many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false\ninformation collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be\ncorrected.  Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become the\nJewish thought police.\n\n\"The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but for\neveryone,\" says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at the\nMassachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitors\nright-wing extremist groups.  \"That's fine but it can't do that and\nspy on Palestinians.  It's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral.\"\n\n\"My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats.  Each of the\nhats independently is appropriate.  It is a broad-based human rights\ngroup that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.\nIt is a group that defends Jews against defamation.  Entirely noble.\nNothing wrong with that hat.  It is a group, whose leaders, at least,\nconsistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, which\nagain is entirely appropriate.  And it is a group that maintains an\ninformation-sharing arrangement with law enforcement.  Again, there is\nnothing wrong for a group to do that.\"\n\n\"But you can't do all four.  It is impossible to do all four and not\nviolate the bounds of ethics.  There's a built-in conflict of interest\nif you wear all four hats.\"\n\nADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict.\nIn a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: \"ADL\nhas a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil\nrights and constitutional freedoms.  Any imputation of an effort or\nmotive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is\nfalse and baseless\"\n\n\"Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC's spying], Friedman describes the\ndissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence\nof files as a token of McCarthyite inclination.  The depiction is\nmisleading in several ways.  Virtually every journalist, academic,\npolitician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem\nrelevant; tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges, the\nLibrary of Congress is tantamount to the KGB.  Moreover, disseminating\nthe public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor\nMcCarthyism.\"\n\nBut many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business.\nAsk Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New Jewish\nAgenda -- all past targets of ADL smears.  (At the same time, the ADL\nexonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assisted\nRonald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADL\nleaders.)\n\nIn the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet\nfact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-Semite\nLyndon LaRouche.  \"Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this\nreally terrific investigator,\" says Berlet.  \"So we introduce\nourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and\nbasically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political\nactivities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to.\nObviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds\nadmirably.

We basically stumbled out\nof there in a daze.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n               Letters (response to Friedman's article)\n\n         The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20\n\nA LEAGUE OF HIS OWN\n\nRobert I. Friedman's assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti-\nDefamation League Is Spying On You.\" May 11] demonstrates that he has\nan axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.\nIt also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down\non his list.  The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and\noutright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from\nreality as to be farcical.  Friedman is even wrong on such basic,\neasily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not New\nYork) and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located\n(not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured).\n\nADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without\n\"spying\" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for\nthe law.  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-\nJewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor\nthem primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.\nThrough the years, we have published scores of reports on anti-\nSemitism emanating from both the left and the right.  In fact,\nalthough Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL's\nprimary concern is still the far right.\n\nBecause extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL\ncan learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.\nFriedman's hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a\nmanner directly analogous to investigative journalists.  Some have\nperformed great service to the American people -- for example, by\nuncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training\ncamps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk.  The\ninformation ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and through\nthe years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting.\n\nFriedman's article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that\nit would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.\nA few examples:  He states that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in\nthe [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation,\" and that Pollard's\nhandler's wife \"worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.\"  Not true.\nFriedman also states:  \"ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped\nPalestinian funerals.\"  Not true.  Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL was\nobsessed \"with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\"  Again, not true.\nWe could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal\n*his* sources.\n\nThe distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further\nreveal his lack of objectivity.  When it comes to how much ADL paid\nRoy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee\n(an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includes\nthe zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large\nnumber.  By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock \"nearly\n$170,000\" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that\namounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum.\n\nWhat is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's description\nof ADL's four hats.  Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and\ndiscrimination.  Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.  And yes,\nADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement\nregarding extremist activities and hate crimes.  We see no conflict in\nthese four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won't\neither.\n\nABRAHAM FOXMAN\nNational Director\nAnti-Defamation League\nManhattan\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nROBERT I. FRIEDMAN REPLIES:\n\nFor the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd.\nJournalists don't spy on Arabs and anti-apartheid activists and then\nfreely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence.\nBut according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators,\nbuttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews, the ADL\ndoes.  Indeed, the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semitic\nnor violent.  Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream\ngroups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now.  Respected intellectuals and\nMiddle East scholars who disagree with the ADL's political views have\nended up on ADL blacklists, their reputations smeared.  \"Private\norganizations have no business paying operatives inside police\ndepartments or having spies,\" says an April 17 editorial in the _St.\nLouis Post-Dispatch_, condemning ADL spying.  On April 10, police\narmed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and\nL.A. after concluding that \"ADL employees were apparently less than\ntruthful\" in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier\nsearch, according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth's sworn\naffidavit.  Roth also asserts that Bullock was a \"paid employee for\nthe ADL.\"  If so, by failing to pay taxes on $170,000 of income paid\nto Bullock, the ADL could face a total of 48 felony counts, according\nto court papers.  The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally\nobtaining confidential information from police computers.  As for\nerrors:  The ADL was founded in Chicago, and moved to New York in\n1947.  But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building\nshown in the _Voice_ photo, moving out a few months ago.  I never\nwrote that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in the [Pollard]\nIsraeli spy operation.\"  I reported that Pollard himself made the\ncharge.  And in court papers, Pollard's own lawyer said that the wife\nof Pollard's handler worked for the ADL.  If I have a bias, it is on\nthe side of the First and Fourth Amendments.\n\n"}

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it\nis when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding\nthe pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported\nby the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.

I can imagine\nhow horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:\nsuddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of\ncontrol of your body---and not knowing the cause.\n\n``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''

Rags strewed the mud floor around an \n iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black \n with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As \n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face \n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \n as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

He yawned.\n 'Did you see any Turk officers?'\n 'No, sir. I was in at dawn.

Anyone keelhauled\n so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \n laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\n Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would\n have been.\n\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last \n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \n looms, even spinning-wheels.\n\n 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must \n leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And \n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \n Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'\"\n\np. 354.\n\n\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\n high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\n but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust\n of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on\n Moslem villages.\"\n\np. 358.\n\n\"It will be three hours to take,\" Dro told me. We'd close in on three\n sides.\n\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" Merrimanov\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\n\"That is for morale,\" Dro put in. \"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\"\n\"Soldiers or civilians?\" I asked.\n\"There is no difference,\" said Dro. \"All are armed, in uniform or not.\"\n\"But the women and children?\"\n\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\"\n\np. 360.\n\n\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said \n Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\"\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble \n where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet \n had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between \n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \n dress.\n\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \n pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \n just below his neck, into the spine. \n\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was \n empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking \n colonel.

Such things are derived from Biblcal\ntexts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.\n\nYou are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this\nis alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes\nto the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs,\nthere is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the\ndoctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the\ntexts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be.\nAccording to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.\n\nTherefore, when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and\nthinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the\nBible, people consider him a cult.\n"}
