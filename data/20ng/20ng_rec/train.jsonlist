{"group": "rec.autos", "text": "From: swdwan@napier.uwaterloo.ca (Donald Wan)\nSubject: $ 80 SVX OIL CHANGE\n \nOrganization: University of Waterloo\nLines: 17\n\n\n\n\n\n My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and I\nthink its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru\ndealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer\ntold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to\ndisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.\nAt first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto\nbut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any\nSVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is\ntrue, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car\nlooks great.\n\nSWD Wan.\n\n"}

A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!\n\t\n\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\n\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu\n"}

There are two big problems:\n\n\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\n\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\n\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\n \t  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on\n\t  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\n\t  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\n\t  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score\n\t  being reported on WIP.\n\n\t2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\n\t  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\n\t  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\n\t  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\n\t  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\n\n-Alan\n"}

{"group": "rec.sport.hockey", "text": "From: accgsg@vaxa.hofstra.edu (Gary Graffagnino)\nSubject: Isles / Hockey Ramblings\nLines: 43\n\n\n\tWell, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a\ndefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it's \"called for\".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,\n\nGary at Hofstra\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET\n"}

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed\ngetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)\nhit the pavement with a \"clunk\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the\npaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the\nhelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a\nfiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.\nThis is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a\nwider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\nof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure\nis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet\nmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.

Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the\ndealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on\nwhat he's seen and heard from his customers. \n\nSaturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, \nfully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or\nso, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more\nlike $120.

But the\npitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player\nis on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive\ngame than of the defensive game.

Alexander Mogilny led the\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\nLaFontaine all night.\n\nRoster move:\n\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\nscratch.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-McGill\n\nTommy Soderstrom\n\nGame Summary:\n\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t74 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t121 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t52 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t121\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t84\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner\n\n"}

Dog attack!\nReply-To: ryan_cousineau@compdyn.questor.org (Ryan Cousineau) \nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Computer Dynamics-Vancouver B.C.-(604)986-9937 (604)255-9937\nLines: 59\n\nMy previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or\nsomething. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n                                                                                       \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+\n"}

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\nto play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the\ndifferences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I\nwould think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.\n\n\n                                    -Sean\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************************\n  \"Behind the bag!\"\n            - Vin Scully\n*******************************************************************************\n"}

Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\n \nDodger\n\n"}

Atlanta is just so strong with their \n.188 BA, Cincinnati is 2-7 coming off a sweep at Veteran's Stadium in \nPhiladelphia, and Houston was swept in it's first three games by the \nPhillies in the Astrodome.  That, my Western Division friends, shows \nthat the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you \nthink!!\n\nPHILS ALL THE WAY IN '93\nBRAVES HIT LIKE A AAA CLUB\nREDS NEED MARGE\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-BOB\n"}

I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.\nIn fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person\nis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably\nbe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.\n\nHe said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad\nstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to\nlearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took\nthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived\nin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't\nand wouldn't play a lick of defense.\n\nIt's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought\nall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has\ncertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at\nthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up\npermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it\nwouldn't matter.\n\nIf I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would\nbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.

Kinda Offical...\nSummary: Supposed \"Higher power output\".\nDistribution: rec.motorcycles\nKeywords: Using Splitfire plugs for performance.\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 54\n\n\nYo, Whaz up!!!\n\nEarlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\nfires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\n\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.  Then he asked the guy...\n\n\"What happened...\"   \"I dumped the clutch...\"\n\"How fast...\"        \"Pretty fast...\"\n\"Insurance...\"       \"Nope.\"\n\nThe fixer smiled.....\n\n\"What do you know about bikes?\"   \"Not much.....\"\n \n"}

They give their\ngeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best\nplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\n\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\nplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\ncan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\n\nIncreasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm\nclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian\nplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft.

{"group": "rec.sport.hockey", "text": "From: farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu (Droopy)\nSubject: AHL Season in review (off ice stuff)\nOrganization: Clarkson University\nLines: 114\nNntp-Posting-Host: craft.clarkson.edu\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\nHere is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\naffected the AHL this year.\n\n\nST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\nThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

Yeah, right.\n\nI expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no\nidea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to\nrelease Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,\nOtto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out\na problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,\nand excruciatingly prolonged.)\n\n>3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing.

Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't\n>been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\nDon't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which\nwas a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.\nMeanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a\nsix-year free agent before the 1992 season.\n\n>9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n\nTwice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.\n\n>10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? \n>Now his value has increased immensely.\n\nBut so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life\nof a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.\n\n>11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\n\nBut he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his\ndisastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign\nhim.\n\n>Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\n>Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis.

Anybody who acquires\nLonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is\na real weirdo.\n\n>12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO.

Too bad. [that he gave him away in the\n>expansion draft.]\n\nIt's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them\nto retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think\nbigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for\nJohn Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch\nlast year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something\nin 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement\nparts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to\nthe Bucs' future.\n\n>14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it.

Personally, I think it's your Duty As a Citizen\nto make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll Give Up\nand Leave Us Alone Someday Soon.\n  The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing\nyour speed.  Mr. Brown (the author of Fight Your Ticket) mentions an\nOakland judge who convicted a speeder \"on the officer's testimony that\nthe driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed.\"\n  You can pay off the State and your insurance company, or you can\ntake it to court and be creative.  Personally, I've never won that way\nor seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely.  And I haven't\nseen _that_ many attempts.\n  You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the\ncars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they therefore\nappear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater than\nit actually is.  I left out a step or two, but you get the idea.  If you\ncan make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win.\n  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to see\nsome other poor biker try it.  He was mixing up various facts like\nthe maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at which\nthe cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn't\npossibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested.  He'd\nbrought diagrams and a calculator.  He was Prepared.  He lost.  Keep\nin mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours.\nMaybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time.\nBesides, this guy didn't speak English very well, and ended up absolutely\nconfounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd been\nrecently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota.\n  Ahem.  OK, I'm better now.  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation\nbeen more polished.  Maybe not.  He did get applause.\n"}

When that light goes on, I just\ntake it to the delaer tell them \"It's that time\" and they work on it for 4 hou\nand you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)\nI currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for\nservice, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the\nOxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have\nnever had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.\nNow, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have\nsomething to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only\nMAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced\nif you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and\nGasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  \n\nWhat I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need\nto, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for\nanother 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light\nbothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against\nthe dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light\nwill go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't\nfind it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little\nand good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?\n\n\t\t\t\t- Thomas -\n\n******************************************************************************\n*  E-Mail Address: \t\t  *  \"Give me an an army of West Point,      *\n*\tTJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU\t  *   graduates and I'll win a battle...     *\n*\t\t\t\t  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     *\n*  \"Creator of MOT POWER!\"\t  *   and I'll win a war.\"                   *\n*\t\t\t\t  *\t  - Gen.

If you plan on\npaying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card\nautomatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may\ncover rental cars also.\n\nMost rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and\nrequire you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.\n                                                                                                          \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+\n"}

Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 117\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n1.015 Sandberg\n .865 Alicea\n .852 Thompson\n .755 DeShields\n .705 Doran\n .678 *NL Average*\n .656 Biggio\n .602 Harris\n .582 Randolph\n .580 Morandini\n .573 Lemke\n .571 Lind\n .336 Stillwell\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.838 Baerga\n.812 Alomar\n.811 Fletcher\n.806 Whitaker\n.757 Blankenship\n.725 Miller\n.718 Knoblauch\n.708 Reed\n.704 Bordick\n.691 *AL Average*\n.636 Kelly\n.631 Ripken\n.603 Reynolds\n.602 Sojo\n.555 Sax\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

Everyone is\nhealthy for the Jets.  I'm biased.  :)\n\nCalgary vs. Los Angeles - Flames in 6\nFrom what I have seen, the Kings have looked flat lately.  I just can't see\nthem getting by the Flames.\n\nFinal- Jets in 6.\nThe Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '93.  They will, but it will be a\nclose series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.  I\ndon't think he'll be 100%, and while it will help, it won't be enough.\n\nNorris Division\n---------------\n\nChicago vs. St. Louis/Minnesota\nChicago in 6 against the Blues, 7 against the Stars.  \n\nDetroit vs. Toronto - Wings in 6.\nThe Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk.  Chelvadae is\nmore experienced than Potvin.\n\nFinal - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it.\nBelfour is better than Chelvadae, IMHO.\n\nConference Final - Hawks in 6.  It hurts, but the Hawks are more experienced,\nand that will carry them through to the final.\n\nPrince of Wales Conference\n--------------------------\n\nAdams Division\n--------------\n\nBoston vs. Buffalo - Bruins in 6.\nB's can check, Juneau is darn good, and Neely.  The Sabres rely too much\non Lafontaine and Mogilny.\n\nQuebec vs. Montreal - Montreal in 7.\nClassic battle, the inexperience will hurt the Nords, this year.\n\nFinal - Bruins in 5.  Habs will be hurting from their series with the Nords,\nand Boston has been able to control the scorers on the Habs.\n\nPatrick Division\n----------------\n\nPittsburgh vs Islanders/Devils - Pens in 5.\nOne word.  Mario.\n\nWashington vs. Devils/Islanders - Caps in 6 / Devils in 7.\nI think the Caps can beat the Isles, but not the Devils.  Tabaracci has been\nstrong in goal, and if he plays like last year, he could carry the team.\nIt doesn't matter, though.\n\nFinal - Pens in 5.  Two more words.  Stevens.  Jagr.\n\nCup Final - Pens in 6.  Three last words.  Tocchet.  Murphy.  Barrasso.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this is that the Pens woofers are going to\nbe out in full force again.

The goalie\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\nfor his team.\n\nEposode Summary\n---------------\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\nhe bought from the concession stand.\n\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty.\"\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\n\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\nand the AHL championships.\n\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\nwent cold.\n\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\nbe a 'country club'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the\nyardarm by their thumbs.\"\n\n\nRating\n------\nNothing too special in this episode.\n\nI'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

Actually, the SC300 (the\n  coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0\n  liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared\n  with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new\n  luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three look\n  completely different.\n\n--Aamir Qazi\n-- \n\nAamir Qazi\nqazi@csd4.csd.uwm.edu\n--Why should I care?  I'd rather watch drying paint.\n"}

You might have\nto pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on the\nstreet under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,\nor even around Gate 1.

His 1988 figure was slightly below average.\nHis 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of\nthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the\nPadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and\njudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play\nthird.\n\n>Williams, Matt       ----  ----  .633  .653  .656   0.647\nAdd another to the elite fielders list.\n\n>Caminiti, Ken        ----  .675  .630  .653  .596   0.642\n>Sabo, Chris          .751  .626  .616  .613  .575   0.642\nToo fielders whose career average may overstate their value.

If you're feeling\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\nthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\n\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\nnet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.\n\nBy now you're probably asking \"So who's the KotL already?\". Well, as\nJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \"secret\" left around\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\nKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\nDead-Head.\n\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\n\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\ne-mail address. For example:\n\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\n\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\nrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\n\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\n\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]\n\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \nargue with each other and plan rides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it's the file name for \nthe group's primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \nto as the DoD.\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Norway and Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \nDoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's \n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \n\"Joust.\"\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to \nget together.  Long may they flame.\n\n\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\t[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \nability and your cat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\nwomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\nhalls of academe for generations. \n\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \n\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\nthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\nnumber. \n\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\nminded enough to accept us as members. \n\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \n\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \n\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\nincludes name, state, and email address. \n\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \n\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\n\n\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\n \n\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \n              :-(  x    / /         \\ \\    x   )-:     \n             :-(  x    / / -\\-----/- \\ \\    x   )-:    \n            :-(  L     | \\/  \\   /  \\/ |     F   )-:   \n            :-(  I     | /    \\ /    \\ |     L   )-:   \n            :-(  V     \\/ __   /   __ \\/     A   )-:   \n            :-(  E     / /  \\     /  \\ \\     M   )-:   \n            :-(        | |   \\   /   | |     E   )-:   \n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \n            :-(  O     | \\___// \\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \n            :-(         \\     \\_/     /      O   )-:   \n            :-(  F       \\___     ___/           )-:   \n            :-(  L        \\ \\     / /        L   )-:   \n            :-(  A         \\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \n             :-(  x        \\_______/        x   )-:    \n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      The DoD\n\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\n \nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

Terrible\nBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to\nReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: \n\nTerrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! \n\nMuck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW\n     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\n     11 but what the heck.  \n\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.\n\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at\n     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!\n     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a\n     Woosh-a-stream.\n\nStompin: You mean Wee-Stream.\n\nTerrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???\n\nStompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see\n     what they say, eh? \n\nMuck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.\n\nHigh Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.\n\nArlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!\n\nTerrible: B.T.???\n\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\n\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.\n\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \n\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\n\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.\n\nMuck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.\n\nChunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!\n\nTerrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???\n\nChunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean \n     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! \n\nMuck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.\n\nOut of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with\nDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and\nthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! \n\nHeritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?\n\nTerrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?\n\nHeritick: Nahhh.\n\nHooter: Hoot, Hoot.\n\nBuck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?\n\nHooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!\n\nMuck: What's a carbujector?\n\nHooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!\n\nMuck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!\n\nDill: Well, where do we race?\n\nSnob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't\n     ride! \n\nMuck: No! No! Quiet!\n\nTread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.\n     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!\n\nHigh: My 9 too!\n\nTerrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!\n\nStompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!\n\nBefore this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more\ncohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the\ninfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! \n\nPolyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like\n     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting\n     it up on the ole ventral stand!  \n\nTerrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and\n     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! \n\nBooster: I hate Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.\n\nBooster: I love Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW WE KNOW.\n\nMuck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?\n\nSnob, Tread: Nawwwwww.\n\nMuck: What about a Tridump?\n\nTerrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?\n\nMuck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?\n\nHeritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?\n\nMuck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.\n\nTwo more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.\nPill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.\n\nPhalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.\n\nAnd Now even more west coasters pour in.\nRoad O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!\n\nMaulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!\n\nSuddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:\nKite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.\n\nRobo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.\n\nMore riders from the west coast come into the discussion:\nAviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.\n\nGuess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.\n\nWith a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It\nwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. \nClean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. \n\nMuck: Why??\n\nClean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.\n\nMuck: But I only have a 4-banger.\n\nClean: No GOOD!\n\nChunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!\n\nClean: Inferior!\n\nStompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys\nburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a\nthrill... \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? \n\nHeritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,\n     WILHEM! \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? \n\nAnd so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the\nthunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all\nboomed out.\nG.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding\n     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. \n\nAll: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.\n\nDoes this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding\nmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the\nnext gut wretching episode of \"The Yearning and Riderless\" with its\never increasing cast of characters.

Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat\nBoy.] \n\nChuck [Sings to the tune of \"The Lumberjack Song\"]:\n\nI'm a Denizen and I'm okay,\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:\nHe's a Denizen and he's okay,\nHe flames all night and he rides all day.\n\nI ride my bike;\nI eat my lunch;\nI go to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays I ride Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus]:\nHe rides his bike;\nHe eats his lunch;\nHe goes to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays he rides Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\n'Cause He's a Denizen...\n\nI ride real fast,\nMy name is Chuck,\nIt somehow seems to fit.\nI over-rate the worst bad f*ck,\nBut like a real good sh*t.\n\nOh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\nOh, He's a Denizen...\n\nI wear high heels\nAnd bright pink shorts,\n full leathers and a bra.\nI wish I rode a Harley,\n just like my dear mama.\n\n[Chorus refrain]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Why you have to be killed.\n\nWell, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed\nto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started\nas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\n\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\nstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\nto the occasion and replied:\n\n\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\"\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\nknown) include:\n\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\t\tDoers of Donuts\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\t\tDebasers of Daughters\nDickweeds of Denver\t\t\tDriveway of Death\nDebauchers of Donuts\t\t\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\nlimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\n\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\n\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\n\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\nto use the archive.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nVia ftp:\n\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\n\nVia e-mail:\n\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\n\ndir [dod]\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\n\nand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\n\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\nthe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of\n50K each; not a good idea.\n-- \nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\n\n**********************************************************\n\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Patches? What patches?\n\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That's sick!\", or\nperhaps \"That's sick! I want!\"\n\nWell, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\nthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\nnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\nsomeone says \"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\nthis is anarchy in action.\n\nHere's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\npopular demand].\n\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\nyou'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\n\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\n\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\nthe other day.\n\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\n\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\nDenizens of Doom!

Rides:\n\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\n\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\n2-strokes.  And though it's not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\nto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

Most of the Flames neglected\nto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least\nfive posts! The Flames best line was probably\nSkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary\nSuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored\nby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made\nsome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially\nimpressive. \n\nThe games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and\nnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,\nhits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's\ngame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no\nidea how serious - he didn't return.\n\nI still think the Flames should win this series, but they better\nbuckle down.\n\n- Vlad the Impaler\n\n"}

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}

It's only been in the last\nyear or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.\nVW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for\npassive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would\nactually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.\n\nVW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the\narticle in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and\nJettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have\nthe quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US\nlaunch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk\nof the useful life of the design is spent.\n\nI think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same\nquality and availability issue.  It's a nice car with a nice engine.\nWhether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a\ndifferent question...\n\nI'll leave the Passat / Camry flamewar for someone else.\n\n\n\n"}

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?

I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n"}

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\n>a first time rider.

If\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.\n\nHope this helps,\n-David\n(dagibbs@qnx.com)\n"}

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \nam wrong.  \n\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\nyear is stealing bases.\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\nor anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.\nAndy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is \nthis a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?

They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything\nabout my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if\nthey didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since\nI charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied,\nI would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork \nto me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.\n\nI called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is\ngood news.  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been\nover week and I have gotten nothing.  So how effective are these types of \ncompanies? Anybody care to share their experiences?\n"}

Yes, I know\nhe was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than\nSlaught, but that doesn't answer the question.

Of course it didn't have the initial power\nburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also\nhad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a \nbit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the\ntime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of \"slip\" device in the shaft\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!\n\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\ndo a \"stoppy\"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike \nup about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these\nactivities anymore (now that I'm an \"old guy\" with kids of my own) but\nit looked damn impressive!!\n\n  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed\nin that direction! :-)\n\nCheers, \nB**2\n"}

Especially when it \ncomes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox\nfan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you\nwith short memories. short lives, or both.  \n\nTo be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism\nfrom those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based\non the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a \nteam, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean\nyears, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  \n\nYeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if\nClemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The\nfact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans\nsupported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of \ndetracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what \nhappens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly \nnot that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,\nremember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that\nfar, let alone beat Baltimore.\n\nLet's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football\nand Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what\nthe outcome will be over the course of 162 games.\n\n===============================================================================\n| joec@godot.cyprs.rain.com     |WARNING: Elvis impersonating can be hazardous|\n| joec@ursula.ee.pdx.edu        |         to your health -- it sure won't help|\n|                               |         your reputation.                    |\n+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+\n| I bike, therefore I am!       | Go Red Sox!

It's odometer turned 90k\nand the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said\nit was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He\nsaid, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it\nhad 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He\nquoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30\noutside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor\nis placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it\nmalfunctions before I do anything.  If anyone out there owns a chevy\nsprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed. Also,\ndid you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. Also,\nwhat are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction. \n  Any help would be greatly apprecisted\n   Thanks\n      Nagesh\n"}

The\n\treporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he\n\tgave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with\n\tthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that\n\tspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not\n\tthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac\n\tMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his\n\tbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations\n\temploy Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being\n\tthe Oakland A's.\n\n\tAnother point:\n\n\tNearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.\n\tYet, most report that they'd never really felt black until\n\tplaying ball in the US.\n\n  \n\tIronically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American\n\tbaseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that\n\tbaseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,\n\tas many \"light black\" or \"brown\", Latin Americans were\n\tincorporated into baseball. \n\n\t/S\n-- \n\"I did not know the cure for the disease      ------------------- \n of images, but I believed in the healing     |  Sandra Vigil   | \n power of words and stories.\"                 |  vigil@esca.com |    \n             - Until the End of the World     ------------------- \n"}

To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\n \n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\n\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\n ----------------------------------\n\n It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce. \n\n OTHER LISTS \n -----------\n\n        Two-strokes:     2strokes@microunity.com\n        Harleys:         harley-request@thinkage.on.ca\n                         or  uunet!watmath!thinkage!harley-request\n        European bikes:  majordomo@onion.rain.com\n                         (in body of message write: subscribe euro-moto)\n\n\n thanks, be seeing you, \n Rich (race list administrator)\n\n rich@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n-- \nStefan Fielding-Isaacs                                415.822.5654 office/fax\ndba Art & Science              \"Books By Design\"      415.599.4876 voice/pager\nAMA/CCS #14\n* currently providing consulting writing services to: Gain Technology, Verity *\n"}

Two bolts attach it to the  \nengine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  \npart was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  \nrounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   \nWow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  \nthe new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.\n\nThis is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  \nmanual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  \ncylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.\n"}

If there really is a qualitative difference between the\nminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't\nbelieve there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good\nseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent\nseason?

A family sedan designed to be\noperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\nlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the\n*brakes.*\n\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\nbrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\ninadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of\nthe car is not up to par.\n\nI picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in\nmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much\ncheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\nthe following to be true:\n\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n   much higher than 120km/h.\n\nI strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people\nhave no respect for their own lives.\n\n>>You certainly haven't convinced me.\n\n>\tOf course not.  \"Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal. \n>I-will-not-speed.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\nand giving up 6.6/game. \n\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game\nwith California was cancelled.\n\n--salty\n\n"}

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is\na *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.\n\nConsider the Red Sox game last night.

Yet only Quantrill got credit for\nthe win.\n\nHow about the offense?\n-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either\n one, the Sox would have lost in nine.\n-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.\n-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first\n to third when...\n-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.\n-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of\n a help, but it was something.\n-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the\n way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)\n\nCooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were\ncredited with RBIs.

Cooper provided the\ngame-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with\nonly one out!\n\nAssigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You\ncan argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the\nclutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.

Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously\nsuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\nor more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\n\n>Mike, I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural\n>affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total\n>waste of time for you (assuming your total \"training\" hasn't come from\n>simply from reading rec.motorcycles).

In fact,\n>it doesn't mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.\n\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\npositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\n\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\n>tied, for another .22.

In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not\n>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There's clearly a problem here.\n\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\nThus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\nthe pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \n\n\n\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\n>\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.

If\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\n\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \n\n>Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\n>\n>Does this make sense?\n\n\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\nwould win.\n \nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\ngoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\n\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\n\n                                                        Brian Smith\n"}

Or Darrell\n>Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in\n>Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon.\n\n\tOh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't \nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\nOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \n\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  \n\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been \na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \n\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you \nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\n\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.\n\n>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\n>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\n>marginal.\n\n\tLemme ask you this.

Big deal.\n>Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something\n\n\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\n80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\n\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\nstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\nSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.\n\n>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When \n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\n\n\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.\n\tSkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\nabout Morris' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris' \"ability\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned \nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\n80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\nnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\n\"consideration\".  \n\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's \njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\n(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)\n\tPuck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \ntragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the\nleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.\n\n\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \nor not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

My 1975 Saab 99\ndidn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition\nto the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another\nset integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who\ndon't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic\ngrowth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out\nof the front fender, which incorporated amber \"parking lights\", amber side\nmarker lights/reflectors, white \"cornering lamps\" (like American luxury\ncars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators\non, and white \"backup lights\" aimed towards the back of the car when you\nhave selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front\nmounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's\ntoys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the\nwheels turned while backing up.\n\nMart L.

How good does their rotation look?  The last I heard, the order is\n>Tapani, Erikson, Mahomes, Banks, and some guy I've never heard of. \n>(sounds pretty pathetic to me)\n\nWell, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who \"hasn't \nmatured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old \nwho is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and \nhave looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim \nDeshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies \nhasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has \ngone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. \nI personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.\n\n>\n>2.  Who is playing short and third?\n\nWell, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but \nwas a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is \nsplit (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry \nJorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 \nyears.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be \nhappy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they \nmight give too much time to Pags.\n \n>3.

Jacking up the frame some more\n(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden \nplatform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to\nraise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring\nfree of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to\nundo the pin holding the spring pack together.\n\nThe spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head\non the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...\nI soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.\n\nFlipped the bottom spring and then...\n\n>>Is this a nightmare waiting to happen, or an easy, though physically\n>>demanding, thing to do?\n>\n>Well, it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 :-)\n>(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly\n>difficult.)\n\nI donno ...

A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of\ntorque spec ...\n\nIt was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  \nSqueeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on\nwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth\nand sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\n\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.\n\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\nhole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\nforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \nit back... hmmm...).\n\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\n\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\nAt least it now sits level..\n\n-- \n\nE.

The way they were used at\nthat time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one\nof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of\nthe Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched\na complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It\nwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the\nyear for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.\nAlso notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1\nthrough October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than\nthe other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that\nstretch.\n\n-----\nEric Smith\nerics@netcom.com\nerics@infoserv.com\nCI$: 70262,3610\n"}

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

I kid you not.\n\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\nup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\n\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\n\"parking your lid\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.\n--\nJerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI, HOGSSC, BCSO, AMA, DoD #18\nChemistry Dept., Harvard Univ.  \"It's my Harley, and I'll ride if I want to...\"\n"}

During the second  Imlach\nera, when Darryl Sittler was called a \"cancer on the team\", he tore the\nC off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.\n\nSittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly\ncaptaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.

Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried\nto give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.\n\nThe best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late\nof the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably\none of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of\nplaying coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be-\ncame the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a\ncaptain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the\nplayers.

ESPN had\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\nnight).\n\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They\nmust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something\nto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of\ncontract with baseball.\n\nSo relax.  I'm happy.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\n\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't \nhave team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \n\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\n\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\nfit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to \nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\n\nIt doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\ncould just be Ozzie.

Can't believe people actually put\n>win as first in a tie breaker......\n\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\nthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\n\n            \"When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.\" \n"}

This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.\nThere is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other\npitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first\nor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the\nmound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most \nruns wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage\n(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low \nscoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many \nlow scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.\nOn the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,\nI would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.\nThey would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their\nopponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that\nyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.\nAll I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers\nlike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.\n\n\nSam\n> \n> -Dave\n> \n> \n>>Sherri Nichols\n>>snichols@adobe.com \n>                                                          \n"}

Trionfo)\nSubject: Re: WFAN\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (USA)\nLines: 92\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu\n\n\n    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment\nof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to\nboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\nMorning show:\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\nJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\nDuring the summer, it\nis all talk on WIP.\n\n\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \n\n\n\n            Rich\n-- \n  \"You've read the hat, now see the movie.\"\n                   -Imus in the morning \n  \"A blurb?

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \nexamples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\n\n>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \n>>true.

The idea was that youngsters could\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\nolder guys did not. \nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\nwasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\ncontributor worth keeping around.\n\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But\nyou have to find the right balance.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Cole  (steve@sep.stanford.edu, apple!sep!steve)\nDepartment of Geophysics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305\n"}

Of course there are always early\n   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays\n   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday\n   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the\n   awards ceremony.  \n\n   For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on \n   registration declaration of affilitation.

He stroked a line drive into the\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\n\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\n\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\nthe catch.\n\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\nimpossible.\n\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\nnine games.\n\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\n\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\nof the fan.\n\n\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n\n\n-- \nMark Singer    \nmss@netcom.com\n"}

Qualifications -- one of the worse\nfinishes in last year's prediction contest.\n\nAL East -- 1993\n\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\nthis:\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\n  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\n  -- Indians aren't ready to contend\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better\n  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\n\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\nof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don't really think that Brady\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\nDavis?  That's insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\n  caught stealing.\n\n2. New York Yankees.\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\n  win a division.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.\n\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\n  have a losing record.\n\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.\n\n5.  Cleveland Indians\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\n  Fermin.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\n\n6.  Boston Red Sox\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how\n  you will :->\n\n7.

North-ame-\nricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better \nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many \nbreakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in\nNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because\nof clumsy defensemen.\n\nI have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars\naren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans\nare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the\nclass of his own). \n\nTommi\n"}

He couldn't hit a\nbull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick \nscored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there\nand was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's\ngotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting\nstupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!\n\nAs for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either\nmakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck \ntowards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't\nstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or \ncommitts a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!\n\nAs far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.\nTwo good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first\nround. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they\nshould play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal\ngame as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead\nthey could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive\nshell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he\ncan't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got\nto. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli?? These are the kind\nof young minds we need behing the bench!!    FIRE AL!!!!\n\nJohn Scialdone\nSCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV\n\n**********When your ship comes in, first man takes the Sail********************\n\n\n"}

They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success\nwill have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have\nany presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the\nhell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples\nskin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.\nHe used to be good at it.  We need him now.  \n\nPerhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.\nI was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.\nThese guys are the \"swing\" players for the Wings.  Last year they\ndid a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick\nexit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour\nshould be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a\nnasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  \nScore Gilmour score!\n\nSuggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??\n\t      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line\n\t      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)\n\n* as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up\n\t\t and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,\n\t\tif the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their\n\t\tchecking line against these \"finesse\" players - well then\n\t\tlet them play.\n\n** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.\n** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.\n** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).\n\nI hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and\nout-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending\nor officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.\n\n\n-jake.\n\n\nGO LEAFS !!!\n\n\n\n"}

Their primary function is\nto maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the\nplayers from trying to kill each other. \n\nUmpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most\nof us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she\ndeserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of\nthe rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well.

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t38 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tEric Lindros\t67 1992-93\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tMark Recchi\t117 1992-93\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t51 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t117\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t79\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t58\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t58\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner\n\n"}

I\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\n\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\n\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\nwasn't very fit last year.\n\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\nseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\n\n\n-Pravin Ratnam\n"}

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a\nplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12\nminutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the\ngoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

His equivalent\naverage started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So\nlet us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level\nof play.\n\nThat is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top\nten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave\nWinfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,\nan incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better\nthan any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what\nMattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;\njust ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan\nKlesko's MLEs. \n\nHe got more attention from the media than was warranted from his\nbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.\nThat is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The\nmedia would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a\ngood, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best\nhitter in the majors.\n\nClay D.\n"}

He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\nbad judgement call.\n\n\n>#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n> He\n>is very unlikely to be back next season.\n\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\nhustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough).

Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,\nwas looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords\nget away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!\n\nIt was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous\ngoalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau\nwas serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the\nlast 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.

Jagr did not have a better season than\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\n\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\n     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\n\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\nwould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\nplay.\n\nIn my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\n\n(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\novertime of playoff games).\n\n--\nRoland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu\n"}

It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n> That is good. Very good, in fact.

I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.\nIt's got some error.\n\nOh well.\n\nBill Guilford\n\nstill thinks \"hairy butt is truly ugly\" might be right\n"}

I believe all of the\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \n\nIMHO \nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\nthink it deserves some consideration.\n\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\n\nDarrell Evans - No.\n\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\n\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\n\n|> \n|>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\n|> giving\n|> \n|> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\n|> marginal.\n|> \n|> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both\n|> \n|> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\n|> \n\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\n\n|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors\n|> so\n|> \n|> liberally.

The only reason I do not say definately is he still\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\nprobably will turn into a definately.\n\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\nthe possible votes.\n\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\n\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O.

And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.\n\n\n-- \n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\n*   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

You can talk about how\nimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls\nin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various\ncatcher's rank in \"defense\".  \n\n\tLooking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect\nthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves\n(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I\ncan tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions\nat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  \n\n\tAll we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\nlearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't\nbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n\tNow, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league\npitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan't learn just as well while in the majors?  \n\nDave\n__________\nDave Bonar\nmebonar@lsuvax.sncc.lsu.edu\n__________\n\n"}

They have a streak of meanness that runs much\ndeeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height\nof the 60's racial struggles.  I am absolutely convinced that there are\nkids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the\nhuman intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that\nhave ever walked the earth.  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity\ndecides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral\nhumans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their\nown protection.  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities\nand police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of\nthe very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.\n\nGee, I guess you touched my hot button.  I'd better go cool off somewhere.\n\n\n-- \nTom Mackey          (206) 865-6575        tomm@voodoo.ca.boeing.com\nBoeing Computer Services               ....uunet!bcstec!voodoo!tomm\nM/S 7K-20,       P.O.

He's bulked up too much.  Period.

His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.

That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n>    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n>    released.

Without a good starting point, it's hard\n>    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nI don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with\nthe A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\ncaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\nhim. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're\ncold, its a hitch. \n\n>First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\n>and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\n>will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\n>the bathead more freely.\n\nThe biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable\nwith for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses\ntrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was \nclearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to\nme. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because\nhe's changed his stance so much.\n\nI'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting\nall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw\nhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting\npractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged\nbad hitting habits.\n\n\n\n\nRuss Smith\n*******************************************************************************\n\"I don't know anything about X's, but I know about some O.\"              \n                  George Gervin on being an assistant coach\n********************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n"}

You're not good at math. But bear\nwith me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as \ngetting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd\nhave two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also\nhave two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are\ndifferent.\n\nPerhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again.

If you are uninterested, since I will\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\nkill them.\n\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\n\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\n\n#1\tBRIAN HAYWARD\t\tSeason:\t11th\nAcquired:\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tP (D)\n\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\n\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\n\n#30\tJEFF HACKETT\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tC\n\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\nyear.\n\n#31\tWADE FLAHERTY\t\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\nAcquired:\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\nGrade:\t\tI (A-)\n\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\nmay not ever.\n\n#32\tARTURS IRBE\t\tSeason:\t1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time\nand could throw hard.  Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of\nlosing seasons, lots of walks.  No Cy Young awards.  How does Nolan\nRyan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 Major\nLeague seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of his\nteams games in 1972?  He doesn't compare.  Not even close.\n\nKirby Puckett hasn't done it long enough for me.  Give me 5 more\nseasons like he's been having, then I'll think about it. \n\n"}

We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan't really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n\t  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON'T DRINK SOAP!

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\n\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\n\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's\n\tanother curve approaching)\n\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\n\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\n\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\n\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\n\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\n\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\n\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\n5 speed)?  \n\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\n\n\neliot\n"}

I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\n\nMark\n"}

How do you know that the Sox are\nresponding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely\nsuspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give\nEasler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.\n\n>2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.\nThis was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown\nmuch power yet, though.\n\n>3. Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him.\nHow can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's\nCalderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing\nthose people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe\nit's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as\nwell as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.\n\n>4. Russell is finishing well.\nIn three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?\n\n>5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.\nA bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that\nZupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of\nsmall sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd\nbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware\nthat his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as\nlong as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.\n\n>6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field\n>and just as good at the plate)\nUmmm...sorry, no. I can buy the \"in the field\" part, and I think he'll be\nbetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll\nbe a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little\nluck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,\nVentura, and Palmer will all be better).\n\n>If the sox Pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff, now)\n>and hit like they are so far, they coiuld run away with thee division. but\n>since I think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge\n>of running away with the division, I think that they win be over .500 and at\n>least Third if not Second or First.\n\nSee, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500\nis plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \"could run away with\nthe division\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white\ncoats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If\nRussell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch\njust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could\nbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too\nstupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas\ncontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a\nlefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nGod is a comedian playing to an audience that is afraid to laugh.\n\t- Mark Twain\n"}

The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\n---\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\n\n(28-30=superstar)\n(23-27=star)\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\n(13-17=NHL regular)\n( 8-12=role player)\n\nFINLAND:  \n\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\n\nC-Jari Kurri........25\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\n\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\n\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\n\nSWEDEN:\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\nD-Calle Johansson...18\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\n\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\nC-Thomas Steen......18\n\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\nR-Michael Nylander..13\n\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\nL-Jan Erixon........14\n\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n---\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \n\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\n\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \nplay.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\nDemers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\nthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\narticle, if possible.\n\n>Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and\n>on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have\n>gone in.\n\nI didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't\nthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)\nin the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in\nregardless.\n\n>Oh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)\n\nYep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\n\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \nArmy.  \n\nBut I still hate the team.\n\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is\nwaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New\nJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is\nunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I \nhate that team anyway.\n\n\n\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca (pissed-off Habs fan)\n\n\n\n"}

Besides, around here it is quite rare to see \nbikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or \nopen face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of \nbicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound \nsunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.\n\n>>The question still stands.

I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean\nmy shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered\nmess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight\nt-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really\nspecific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that \nsplattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?\nImage? Laziness?

I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would\nlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.\n\nI'm considering two basic options:\n\n1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs\n    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.\n    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\n\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--\n-- \n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\n \"Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...\"\n"}

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly's infield sneaker\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a \nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\n\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \nargued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\ntossed.\n\nThe Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\n\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\n(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\n\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\n\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\nin late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\nwork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit\nsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.\n\nThe Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory\ntoday.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\n\nMy question:\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\n\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\nelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying\nto give information as completly as I can).\n\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\n\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\n\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\n\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\nit?\n\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\n\n\t1.

A low GAA against good\n> teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\n> of comparing two goaltenders.\n\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n> The same\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\ntickets next season:-).\n\n                                         \\ \\\nJoe Dakes                                 \\/\\\nAT&T Microelectronics                      \\/\\\n555 Union Boulevard                         \\ \\\nAllentown, PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! \nalux1!jmd                                     \\ \\\njmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \\ \\__________\n                                                \\____/_//__/\n\n"}

I would rather have the untried\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\nhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\n\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

Roy stood on his head \nfor the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from \nend-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy.

All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the \nextra 2.\n\nRed Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the\nseries 4-0.

I believed\nthis and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!\n\nI loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just\ncouldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the\nproblems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the\nability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any\nchrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\njust looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.\n\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\n\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\n\nEngine \n4 Alternators\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\n2 Water pumps\n5 thermostats\nHall effect sensor\nMain computer\n4 Batteries\n\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\n\nRadiator\nAutomatic Transmission\nPower Steering\n\n\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\nare still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called\ncompetition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the\nconsumer, well your out..  \n\n*asbestos suit on*\n\nGaia\n\n"}

Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.\n\n``It wasn't pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but\nit did.\"\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It's a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that's all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\n\nSome players didn't have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\" said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.\n\n``I didn't know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,\nand that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend.\"\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\"\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he's happy.\"\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n"}

Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action.

FLYERS management never says bad thing about\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either.

Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these\nwere completed before the first pitch. :-)\n\nAL East\n1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division\n2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.\n3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect\n4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop\n5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing\n6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak\n7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th\n\nAl West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top\n          4 gets pitching should win it.\n1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success\n2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?\n3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.\n4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close\n5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here\n6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs\n7.  California Angels - will win no games\n\nNL East\n1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!\n2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga\n3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected\n4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \"team\"\n5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me\n6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing\n7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing\n\nNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.\n1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern\n2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all\n3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2\n4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993\n5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants\n6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink\n7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.\n\n\nNLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting\n                            what I said in my NL West comment.)\nALCS  New York d. Minnesota\n\nWorld Series  New York d.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.\n\n-TJK\n'85 FJ1100 with \"GET OUT OF MY WAY\" horns.\n\"That looks like a suit you'd fight a fire in\" -comment about the Aerostich\n"}

That was their argument to prove that you don't go\nwrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.\n\n\tNow, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more\nin initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra\non repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car\nneeds repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.\nI would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more\nin repair costs.\n\n--\n----------------->8      Cut here for Signature!       8<---------------------\nBalaji Ramanathan,                   | \nInstitute of Transportation Studies, |         I don't believe in luck!\nUniversity of California, Irvine.    |              I RELY on it!!\n"}

The point of formal training \nmust be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion\nto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike \nin a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.\nCountersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among \nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\n\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \nsituations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of\ncountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\n-- \nstaal@idt.unit.no  \n\n"}

On the other hand, it seems that every clear\ncoated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has\nfine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.\n\nSeveral weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed.\nWhen I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember\nfrom a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car\nto the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my\ncar.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof\n(which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before\nhe dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a\nhaze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light\nhits the roof at a particular angle.\n\nI am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any \nchance of getting the dealership to do something about this?\nMy guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides\na solution to this problem?

We had to get rid of Roberto Kelly, partly \n>\t  because he was under too much pressure in NY to be the next\n>\t  Barry Bonds (he won't do that in Cincy, either), and partly\n>\t  because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up\n>\t  in the second half of the year.

A friend made a comparison between Wickman and Jack\n>\t  Morris - they never have impressive stats but they always\n>\t  find some way to win (although Morris seems to be losing that\n>\t  ability).

Key was just supposed to provide\n>\t  the rotation with some stability (you know, shore up the left\n>\t  side, provide experience, get maybe 15 wins), and here this guy\n>\t  is *dominating* everybody he faces!

Velarde, Stankiewicz, and even Silvestri\n>\t  are better defensively than Owen.\n\n        Remember - it's still early. Look for his offense to tail off, and his\ndefense to improve (hopefully).

I do agree\nthough that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.\n>\n>\t2)Tartabull. The book on Tartabull was, keep him healthy and\n>\t  he'll produce. Well, he hasn't done too much so far. Sure. he's\n>\t  hit a few homers, but those were all solo shots, and he hasn't\n>\t  gotten any of the \"big\" RBIs that your cleanup man is supposed\n>\t  to give you. Then again, he had a slow start last year (once he\n>\t  got off the DL, that is) and turned into a one-man wrecking crew\n>\t  late in the year, so we'll see.\n>\n>\t3)The Bullpen.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\n\n\nMihir Shah\n\t \n"}

(BTW, as of a\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\nGSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \nthem honest about acquiring parts. \n\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\nnot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the \nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\n\nMike\n-- \nDisclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?\nexit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT\n^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!\nman help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel \"Hey, what does Stop L1A d...\"\n"}

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).

Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.\nDublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.

Hence, any apparent\n>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous\n>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling\n>characteristics.\n\nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\n\nI've        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n"}

I then went out shopping for\na new lock for the bicycle.\n\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\n\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\ndon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\n\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \ndark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \nlock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\"\nattack.\n\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the\nweakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient\nyou can cut cables with fingernail clippers.

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.

I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\ntalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and\ntalk some more.\n\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\ncompromise is no compromise.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.\nWe'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good\nabout it.\n\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\n\n                                 END       10:10 A.M.

This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /tmp\nsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         cat -) | \\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n"}

But the demonstration of this\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\n\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles.

NYI has been bagging it of late.\nNYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour\nof Pittsburg anyway.  Pigsburg in 4.\n\nWASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6. \nI think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with\nWASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6.\n\nBOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. \nThe B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last\ntwo weeks.  The only question is how long will it last?\nFuhr is a dud.  BOS in 4.\n\nQUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7.\nIt seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry.\nThe Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5.  \n\nCHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. \nSTL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4.\n\nDET  vs TOR:  DET in 6.\nI am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafs\noffense is shutting down in the last week.  Can they\nturn it around against Detroit.  As I recall, the last\ncouple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled.\nI don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is,\nDET in 5.  If not, DET in 6.\n\nVAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6.\n\nUpset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry.\nThere is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure.\nWIN in 6.\n\nCAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5.\nAnybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does\nnot watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols.\nCAL in 4.\n\n\n2nd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. \nIt seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their\nsaving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place.\nHowever, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little\ntoo high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that,\nI will say PITT in 6.\n\nBOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6.\nMON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.\nThe couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the\nB's.  B's in 6.\n\n\nCHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7.\nYikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine\nof late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played\nlike killers.  DET in 6.\n\nWIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5.\nCAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out\nmuscle WIN.  CAL in 5.\n\n3rd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. \n\nI hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over\nand give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may\nbe something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7.\nCHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. \n\nFinals:\n------\n\nPITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. \n\nNO, no, no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to say\nhere.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.  I will go\nwith goaltending and muscle and say DET in 7.\n\n\n-jake.\n\n\n\n\n"}

New York prohibits their use in\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\n\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\n\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\n    on.\n\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\n\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\n    system.\n\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\n    able to handle it? \n\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\n\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\n\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\n\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\n\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\n\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\n    spinning.\n\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\n\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\n\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\n\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\n\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\n   on the throttle.\n\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\n   the same thing.\n\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\n\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\n   speed up.\n\n   The procedure is as follows:\n   (0) declutch\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\n   (2) engage clutch\n   (3) match revs\n   (4) declutch\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\n   (6) engage clutch\n\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\n   condition.\n\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\n\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\n   2) almost never.\n\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\n   major) part of the equation.\n\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\n\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\n\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\n\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\n\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\n   temperature.\n\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\n\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\n\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\n\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,\n              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation\n\n    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,\n              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company\n\n    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,\n              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin\n\n    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,\n              or Bavarian Motor Works\n\n    MG:     Morris Garage\n\n\nQ:  Does VW own Porsche?\n\nA:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and\n    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\n    is only speculation at this time.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n"}

After driving 4 or 5 miles, \n           it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. \n\nI would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these\nproblems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has\ndone about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/\nrecondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it\nunless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got the\ncar tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions.

Which leads to below:\n\n>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\n>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\n\nI think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here\nwhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for \nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\nimprove as a result.\n\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how\ngood of a GM he really is.\n\n>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\n>so none of this is true anyway.\n\nI may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing\nit with you.\n\n>Gregmeister\n\n--Randy\n\n"}

Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?

Here's a very simele question to which\nI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\n\n>It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out\n>here in the real world guys.\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nComputer...if you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight\noff to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax.

A good used car buy.\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \nI didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it\nfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\nthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so\nI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \n\nI wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume\nthat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\nbut that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\n\nLastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\n\nNathan\nnathan@sco.com\n\n>\n>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>|Jeremy Mereness                 | Support     | Ye Olde Disclaimer:    |\n>|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet)      |    Free     |  The above represent my|\n>| FAST Project, CMU-GSIA         |     Software|   opinions, alone.     |\n>|B.S.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\n\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\nright side.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\nto make a number of starts in a row.\n\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\n-steveg@cadkey.com\n"}

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about\nprospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of\nFame members? It was part of their preseason special.

Fuel injector \ncleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is\nhooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on\nthe solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is\npricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has.

There has been a \ndiscussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron\n(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best.

The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n"}

But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n\t1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n\t2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n\t3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n\ttorque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast?

The \"established\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.\nThe  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team\ncould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did\nwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-\nolistic professional system, in the interests of making money.

I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR\n600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy\nconsidering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a\nfast learner, and in love.  Please give me any advice that you think\nwould help me in my search, including places to look or even specific\nbikes that you want to sell me.\n\n    Thanks  :-)\n\n    Jamie Belliveau (jbc9@andrew.cmu.edu)  \n\n"}

Thats why your car goes faster when\nyou punch the holes in it. All that radiation gets on your engine\nand gives it \"pep\" (scientific term). You get more horsepower &\ntorque too! If you don't know what HP & torque are, you can read\nmile long threads on the subject, but they are all wrong.

That is why low-abiding citizens should have\nthe power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary \nanywhere a threat is imminent.\n\nMy Camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back.\nThe persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) but not before\nhaving trashed the car.\n\nOn another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motel\nfor the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing my\ncar, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenant\nwalked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished. \nNeedless to say, I immediately packed-up and left.\n\nWatch out for car-jacking and staged accidents. They can be deadly!\n\nSteve Heracleous\n"}

I won the battle but \nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\n\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\n\n"}

Here are the highlights:\n\n\n\t\t\t\tR    H   E    \n             Oakland\t\t2    9   0\n\t     Detroit            3    7   1\n\nChad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the \nbottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the\nTigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to\ntie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).\n\nThe A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo\nhomer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the\n7th for the other Tiger run.\n\nJohn Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting\nthrough the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas\nin the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was\nreplaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and\nfinally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while\nWitt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.\n\nIn the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said\nits one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It\nwas a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously\nvery happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:\n\n                WOOF!      Go Tigers!\n\n--Randy\n\n"}

About the only tangible thing we can look at is\nopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. \n\n  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\nbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that\nthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \ndefensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of\nMel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich\nJays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. \nI'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative. \n \n-- \nDave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 \nkirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!\n\"Not to beat a dead horse, but it's been a couple o' weeks .. this \n disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering..\" - Stephen Lawrence \n"}

In the early 80's with the\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.\nJust keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\n\nGood luck.\n"}

If\nOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an\nextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold\nat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than\nAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\ndouble.)\n\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.

Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well\nin the 1950's for all teams.  \n\nBill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon\nKillebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with\n38 times caught stealing.

Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in\ntheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all\nthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.

{"group": "rec.motorcycles", "text": "From: frank@marvin.contex.com (Frank Perdicaro)\nSubject: ST1100 ride\nKeywords: heavy\nLines: 95\n\nSixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\n-- \n\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \t\t\t\tXyvision Color Systems\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 Edgewater Drive\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\t\t\t\tWakefield MA\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\t\t018801285\n"}

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\n\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\nin the game.

Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.

I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n>Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal\n\n>Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota):\n> BLACKHAWKS IN 5.\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.

Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Chicago vs. Detroit:\n> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT.

They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:\n>This would have been tough to call, except for three things. 1/ The\n>Kings don't have a goalie; 2/ Gary Roberts will be back; 3/ the Kings\n>shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (Paul Coffey)\n>for a proven loser (Jimmy Carson).

LA in six.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Vancouver vs. Calgary:\n> FLAMES IN 6.\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.

Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\nall-round players in the NHL.\n\n\n\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca\n"}

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

People turned out to watch him play. \n\nI will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. \nBut this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase \nwill last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking\none.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \n\n>Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. \n\nOk.

An\n>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\n>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\n>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They\n>are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement\n>since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going\n>to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't\n>GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than\n>they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\n>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because\n>they are winning.\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.\n\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \nCFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If \nthat's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious\nto hear your explanation.\n\n\n"}

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n \n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in \nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\n \n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\n\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\n \n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \nthe NHL?\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \nchances.\n \n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\n \n Q: What is the five-hole?\n A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: \n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \nright, and (5) five-hole.\n \n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven \nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\n\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \nlost the game, 6-4.\n\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\n\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \nassistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in \nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\n\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \nColonial Hockey Leagues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n9.

If he was as great a GM as you claim\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\nBut Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\nso none of this is true anyway.\n\nGregmeister\n\n"}

If I'm Joe Torre, I'm\n\tgoing to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's\n\tgot Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - \n\tcoming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign \n\tin that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  \n\tIt's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin \n\twas there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  \n\tBTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third \n\tand going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the \n\treplay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a \n\tserious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year \n\tand I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.\n\n>\n>I can't take this anymore\n>\n\tWell, I'm still hanging in there.\n\n\tGO REDBIRDS!!

But that is\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\nrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n\n-- \nRoger Maynard \nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n"}

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\nare challenging?\n     \"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\" announced\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to\nwin.\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  \"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don't see why we can't win this\ndivision.\"\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\npitcher's park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't\nafford to let the Astros beat us.\"  He then winked and said: \"Well, maybe\nDavis will get decked once.\"\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It's as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     \"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\n     \"We're mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\nplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\nguess that's why they're so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\n     Standings after these weekend series:\nA.L.East\nTeam                     W           L           GB\nNew York                68        42          --\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\nDetroit                 64        46           4\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\nWashington              39         73          28\n\nA.L.West\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\nMinnesota               61         48            1\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\nCalifornia              57         56            8\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\n\nN.L.East\nChicago          57         53                --\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\nNew York         48         64               10\n\nN.L.West\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\nHouston          50          61               17.5\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5\n-- \nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\n"}

But \n>the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens\n>hasn't.\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n>Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement\n>is totally meaningless.

They performed well in two short series and won the\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why? Did Morris somehow \"learn how to win\" in the intervening ten years?\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\na run lower than 1992?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nDon't be humble, you're not that great.\n"}

The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said \"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\n\nMichal\n\n"}

So far, no takers.\nPersonally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he\nhas also led the team in past years for hitting into double\nplays, or at least been among the leaders.\n \nSharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play\nevery day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just\none base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.\n \nWallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.\nThe improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an\neffect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez\nwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.\nMartinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might\nhave seen him lifted in the third in past years.\n \nAstacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.\nThe Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls\nin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great\non defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to\nsteal and has at least one pick off at first.\n \nWallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on\ndefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers\nsome runs.

Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n>   far more predictable than most US highways.\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\n\n>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n>   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n>   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n>   much higher than 120km/h.\n\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\n\n>I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...\n\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\n\n>                                                      ...  Some people\n>have no respect for their own lives.\n\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\na bicycle: Your're dead.\n\nBye,\nStefan\n---\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"...And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court, I accuse you of being the\nreincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\ntries.\n\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\n\n1st period: \n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\nin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\n\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\nthe period.\n\n2nd period: \nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\n\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\n\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\n\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\n\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\n\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\n\n3rd period:\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\n\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\n\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\n\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\n\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \n8:19) took penalties.  \n\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\n\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\n\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\nright out of the game.\n\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\npenalty killing.\n\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\n\nNotes:\n------\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\n\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\n\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\n\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \ngames.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play\nover their last 9 games.\n\nThe teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.\n\nPlayoffs:\nCampbell Conference:\nSmythe Division:\nLA  6  @ CAL 3 \t\tLA leads 1-0\nWIN    @ VAN\n\nNorris Division:\nSTL 4  @ CHI 3\t\tSTL leads 1-0\nTOR    @ DET\n\nWales Conference:\nAdams Division:\nBUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)\tBUF leads 1-0\nMON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)\tQUE leads 1-0\n\nPatrick Division:\nNJ  3  @ PIT 6\t\tPIT leads 1-0\nNYI 1  @ WAS 3\t\tWAS leads 1-0\n\nRecords:\n--------\nvs\tSmythe\t Norris\t Patrck\tAdams\tOverall\n================================================\nHome:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 \nRoad:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0\n==============================================================\nTotal:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0\t0-0-0\t 1- 0-0  \n\nBox Score:\n=========================\nCalgary      0 1 2 - 3\nLos Angeles  1 3 2 - 6\n=========================\n\n1st period: \nLA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16\n    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25\n    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53\n    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34\n    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:30\n\n2nd period: \n    CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34\nCAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)\nLA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)\nLA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37\nLA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36\n    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53\n    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35\n    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40\n    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19\n    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31\n    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:03\n\n3rd period:\nLA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06\n    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24\n    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22\nCAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23\n    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08\n    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44\n    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19\nCAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47\n    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56\nLA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)\n    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38\n    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17\n    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17\n\nOvertime: none\n\nShots:\n------\nLos Angeles   8  9 14 - 31\nCalgary       5  8 11 - 24\n\nPower play conversions:\n-----------------------\nFor:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%\nAgainst:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%\n\nGoalies:\n--------\nLos Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)\nCalgary - Vernon (0-1-0)\n\nAttendance: 18,605\n\nScratches:\n----------\nRob Blake - back contusion\nGuy Leveque - numbers\nLonnie Loach - numbers\nMarc Potvin - numbers\nBrandy Semchuk - numbers\nRobb Stauber - numbers\nBrent Thompson - numbers\nJim Thomson - numbers\n\nLines - Forwards:\n----------------\n*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom \nDonnelly - Millen - Kurri\nRychel - Conacher - Taylor\nGranato - Carson - Shuchuk\n\nLines - Defense:\n----------------\n*Huddy - Sydor\nWatters - Zhitnik\nHardy - McSorley\n\n* denotes starting lineup\n\nNext game:\n----------\nWednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket\n===============================================================================\nStan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)\nnet contact: L.A.

If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\nlearned a few tricks I think...\n"}

I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between\nplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers\nwould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but\nactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  \n\nLet's kick it off with an example of a player who was \"rushed\", although\nthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the\nnext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\nand has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\n\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it.

He also KICKED John McLean. Of\ncourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match\npenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few\nyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in\nmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall.

My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the\ncallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the\ndepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on\nthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent\nnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league\noblivion.

The player must be \nperiodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you \ncannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not \nwish to expose to waivers).

If they get caught, there is no punishment\n at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping\n with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand\n what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen\n any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching\n him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would\n inevitably wind up dead early anyway.\n\n   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,\n he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-\n gradually heat it, the frog will cook.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\nthe salespeople wouldn't give her the \"bimbo\" treatment.\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\"\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\nkept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\".  After\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\nthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \"Don't Get Taken Every Time\" for a\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you'll have to\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\nthousand dollars we'll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can't come down any\nmore so I guess we can't help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\nleaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\nI'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced\nthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,\nwe're going next door to the Nissan dealership.\n\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.\n\nJust so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that the\nsales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his\nrefusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the\nend, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was\na young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of\nus, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.\n"}

The\npull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold\nweather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the\nfast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a\nnormal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply\nsuction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will\ncause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.\n\nBernie Lofaso\nApplied Research Labs\n"}

Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA\nand then does not improve would have been better off making a\ndirect leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then\ndoes not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't\nbelong in the bigs?\n\nNow, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)\nhe jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was\nreturned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now\nhis career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your \npoint.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now\nhe's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.\nDuh.\n\n\n>That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\n>really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\n>or some combination of the two.

The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.\n\nNow I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than\nthe Indians or Tigers.

I see no reason why they\nshouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and\nthe Tigers *still* have no pitching.

I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,\nthen even, otherwise, edge to Cubs\n\nSecond Base:\n\nSandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge\nto Cubs...a big edge.\n\nShortstop:\n\nVizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an\nautomatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.\n\nThird Base:\n\nDave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.\nBuechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to\nFlorida.\n\nCatcher: \n\nSantiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to\nMarlins\n\nLeft Field:\n\nConine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.\nI watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves\nhimself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position\nwhere Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.\n\nCenter:\n\nScott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the\nCubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May\nisn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays\nfull time.\n\nRight:\n\nFelix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does\nSosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs\n\nStarters:\n\nAquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't\nremind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard\nis average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs\n\nMiddle Relief:\n\nEven. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.\nCarpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.\n\nCloser:\n\nA healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but\nno Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.\nLook for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with\na better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.\n\nOverall, an edge to Chicago.\nNeither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.\ne\n--\nmsilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu\t\t\t\tGO CUBS!!!\n\n\"One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball\" - Geddy Lee\n"}

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\nNo problems with winds and curves. \n\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\n\n\n>|> b) I can't understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid\n>|>    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in\n>|>    the low gears.

Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\n----------------------------------------------------\n      |                            | Exit\n      |                            | 130B\n      |                            |\n   \n"}

The ruling in\nCohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision\nin the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial\nLawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest\nlaw firm representing the women athletes.\n   \"This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a\nschool wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of\nopportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,\"\nsaid TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.\n   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that\nprohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions\nreceiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as\nuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to\ncompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for\nuniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also\nbeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.\n   \"This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,\"\nsaid TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &\nLabinger.  \"Universities across America need to reevaluate their\nprograms quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.\"\n   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State\nUniversity, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate\nUniversity are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders\nrequiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity\nteams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is\nrepresenting women athletes at IUP.\n   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:\nRay Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca\n& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\nsame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally\ngood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare\nbetween players on different teams.\n\nI agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful\nare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is\na missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring\nthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a\nbetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice\ntime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low\namounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who\ndoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of\nquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that\nthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than\n+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.\n\n+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.\nYou are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see\nthat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed\nis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.\n\nGregmeister\n"}

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.\"\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.\"\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist.\"\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\"\n\nMelrose's \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \"Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \n\nIf you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

Peter Ahola.\n\n#24\tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\n\t\t2nd round pick in '92 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\nWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\n\n#29\tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nIt's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

THe Berreta\nis a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable\nprice not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one\nsource, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I\nhaven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,\n(so they are similair.)\n"}

Books have been written on that! But in regard to\nAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.\nIf you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero\ndimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching\nthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.\nHaving my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very\nconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in\nprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I\nthink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a\ndifference.

It was quite a game.\nMaine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away\nwith it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.\nLSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.\n\nLSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.\nThe play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.\nLSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.\nNow it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.\n\nCoach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won\nthe game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.\nThe third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored\nthree unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.\nThey were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by\nPaul Kariya.\n\nThe last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also\nproved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU\ngoalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by\nboth.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.\n\nThis year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one\nmonth.

Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit.

If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  \n\njust to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems\nto me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need\nto calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little\nmore.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you\nthe car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should\nlet him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,\nabout the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled\nby drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,\nthough, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault\nfor not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.\nOddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my\nliscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by\ncars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the\nfact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with\nthem, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline\nwill do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything\nover the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe\nthey should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....\n\njust curious, and my .otwo\n\nDREW\n"}

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.\n\ndvb\n"}

In fact, I could\nimagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your \nchances of being \"offed\" or involved in an accident, especially if \nthis \"passer\" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person\nriding your bumper is certainly NOT a \"wise driving practice\", it \nonly causes the jam to become more congested. \n \nI don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the \nroad behind!

If someone decides then to \npull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and \ndo so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).

There are actually many courteous drivers \non the road who do not intentionally impede others.  \n\nIf someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they \nare blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all \nelse fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the \nmessage that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never \nsafe to ride anyone's bumper.

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \"bank-follower\", or a\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\n100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\nmystery.\n\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \n\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you\nrip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without\ndamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\n?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life\ngoes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.\n\nBarry Manor DoD# 620 confused accidental peg-scraper\n"}

There is only one way of determin-\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\nsolutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\nindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\n>The fact is that Morris didn't \"win\" any ballgames, Toronto did, in\n>spite of Morris' \"contribution\".   This has been explained to you\n\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\n\n>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.\n\nYou don't have to be rude.\n\n>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.\n\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\nindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of\ncomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-\nformance.\n\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new\nknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better\nthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less \nincorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.\n\n-- \n\ncordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n                                           \"So many morons...\nrm                                                   ...and so little time.\" \n"}

{"group": "rec.sport.hockey", "text": "From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu)\nSubject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 2: Defensemen (2-19)\nOrganization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.\nLines: 92\n\nI finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending\nit.\n\n\n\n#2\tROB ZETTLER\t\tSeason:\t4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tC/C-\n\nZettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still\nwasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3\tDAVID WILLIAMS\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:\t\tC/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4\tJAYSON MORE\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nAfter being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5\tNEIL WILKINSON\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19\tDOUG ZMOLEK\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!
