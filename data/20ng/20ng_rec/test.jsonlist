I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really\nmeasure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the\ndifference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and\nMorris? The differences are too great there.\n\nIn your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it\nall ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly \"best\",\nhow can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where\nthey beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player\na little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions,\nthe \"best\" player is the one who does the most things to help his team\nwin. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the\nteam, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)\n\nBaseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is\nabsurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success\nor failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most\ncases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe\nCarter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al.\nClemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as\nHerm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality\nof the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly)\nis a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the\nmean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you\ndo)\n\nClay D.\n\n"}

In\nexchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save\n$150/year.\n\nUnfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse\npeople so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.\nI guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance\ncompanies would be pushing harder for repeal.\n"}

The Mariners\nhad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the\nfielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  \n\nNow, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBI\nfor the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be \"defensive\nindifference\", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores\nat that point.  (I know, I can think of several \"If the Mariners stole third\nand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a\ngrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and\nthird, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and\nmaybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...\nscenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when\nyou're down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)\n\nThe point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn't get \"credit\" (an RBI) for utterly\nfailing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not\ntrade an out for one run.  What do you guys think?\n\n\t\t\t\tRegards,\n\t\t\t\tBurke (Charles S. Homan)\n\t\t\t\tchoman@wpi.wpi.edu\n\t\t\t\tGo Red Sox!!!  (11-3)\n\t\t\t\tGo Rocket! (3-0)\n"}

{"group": "rec.sport.hockey", "text": "From: jca2@cec1.wustl.edu (Joseph Charles Achkar)\nSubject: Blues shutout Hawks again, lead series 3-0\nNntp-Posting-Host: cec1\nOrganization: Washington University, St. Louis MO\nLines: 118\n\n4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and\nthe Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\nhours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\n\nBy Dave Luecking\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\n\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\nJoseph.\"  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\n\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\n\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\nBlackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.\n\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\n\nThe Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\n\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \nperiod.\n\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four.\" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.\"\n\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\n\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\n\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\n\nThe Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw\nat him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly\nstyle is deadly.\n\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\n \nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\nslashed Shanahan.\n\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\n\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\nshooting the puck into the Blues' bench.\n\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\nthe Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.\n\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped\neverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period\nand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.\n\nEmerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected\nFelsner's pass.\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*% \n"}

At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if\nat all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need\nto be at 4K RPM to get it.  \n\n>3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\n>in the morning.

Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the\nthrottle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.\nMy R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.\n\nIt's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard\nto learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success\nand failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the\nbattery while trying to get it to run.\n\nIf my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to\nstart.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to\nvaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.

All compliant diesels are turbocharged.\n2. All use an \"aftercooler\", which cools the air which was heated\n   by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI).\n3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air\n   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is\n   low.\n\nNo scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from\nthe turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.\n\nInterestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output \nand mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket\nturbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,\nand these are approved by the CARB.\n\nDan Hepner\n"}

I don't see many people using slip-on's\n>but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive.\n>\n>Thanks!\n>Dave\n>\n\nCost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most \ninstances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more \nperformance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.\nThe mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at \n2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of \nthe slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose\nto but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...\nAnyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,\nwhich is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario \nslip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full \nthrottle.\n\nJust remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or\nexhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may\nhave to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust\nsystem, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point\nwhich re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping\nprofile.\n\nTalk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if\nthey have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the\nsystem also to see what they think about there slip on.\n\nAlso, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a\ngroup of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a \nside bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at\nthe rear wheel, 85 verses 91. \n\nBuyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power!

The Twins took two of three games in the series,\nwith scores as follows:\n\n                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10\n                                        Mil  0\n                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  \n\n                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)\n                                        MN   8\n                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )\n\n                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5\n                                        Mil 4\n                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)\n                    Sa - Aguilera\n\nHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:\n------------------------------------\nJim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of\nthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\nlook like a true genius.\n\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\n0-5.\n\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\nit.\n\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\n\nGeneral News\n-------------------------------------\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\n\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\n\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\n\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\n\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.

I have been\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\n\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\nplugs and valve adjustment.\n\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\nhighway.\n\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\nVisibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\n\n    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\nride later in this review.\n\n\nEngine:\n    \n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\nI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\n(More on this later.)\n\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\n\n    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\nadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves\nare used.\n\n\nTransmission:\n\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\n\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\nlarger and more forgiving.\n\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's\na clumsy shifter.\n\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\npretty amazing in a car like this.\n\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\nToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\n\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter\nupgrade would help at all.\n\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\nwere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\nshifts in higher gears.)\n\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \nget it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple\nof months.\n\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\n\n\nExterior:\n\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\ndon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\n\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\n\n    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\n\n\nInterior:\n\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \n\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\ncassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\nglove compartment.\n\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\nsink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the\ninterior was upgraded!\n\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\n\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\nwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has\ncracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\nway.\n\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\n\n\nRide:\n\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than\nany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\n\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\n\n    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason\nto complain.  Let me explain...\n\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\navoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.\n\n    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\n\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so\nuseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\n\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\n\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n    GRIPES:\n\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\n\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\n\tit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\n\tAgain, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\n\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\n\tand torque steer, I've never complained about ride.\n\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\n\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \n\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\n\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\n\tfor four.\n\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\n\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't\n\treally mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!\n\tPretty ridiculous, though.\n\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\n\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\n\tdown low.\n\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\n\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\n\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)\n\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\n\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \n\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\n\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\n\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\n\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\n\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\n\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\n\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \n\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \n\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \n\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \n\tthe glowing brake light.  Oops.)\n\n    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\n    \tthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\n\tother windows work smoothly.\n\n\n    LIKES:\n\n    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\n    \tcupholders are great.\n\n    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\n\tit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\n\tpressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\n\tyou can never lock yourself out of the car.\n\n    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't\n\tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \n\tahead of schedule.  :-)\n\n    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to\n\tlook into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\n\twrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\n\tand ended up with this.  \n\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\n\tan opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \n\tcar.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this\n\tpoint in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\n\tcan't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\n\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\n\tas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\n\tthe horsepower.  \n\n\n\nOther Odds and Ends:\n\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\nhaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\n\n    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be \nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \n\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\nI don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \nmaybe someone out there does.\n\n\nGene Kim\n(genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)\n\n\n"}

Rickey is VERY good, maybe better  \nthan winfield, I was angry at the dissing of winfield. Though Winfield has  \nbeen better than henderson lately. Check the numbers, winfield may  \nsurprise you.

My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot \npitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least \nappear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot \nexcede three runs.\n\nI believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in \ndetermining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the \nninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in \nthe next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no \nway.\n\nI guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his \nteammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth \nand left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in \nthe ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  The \nthird pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no \"stat\" \nsatisfaction.\n\nMike\n\nI bleed the blue of Dodgers and even like Lasorda spaghetti sauce.\n> \n"}

I'll tell you \nwhat we've found and the systems we've worked out.\n\n- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider\nto judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something\nand leaning forward.  Remember this.\n\n- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally \nthis means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned\nover and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.\nMuch balance is lost and this can be dangerous.\n\n- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough \nfor the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding \nonto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast\nbecause braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which \nshoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.\n\n- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not \nout wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.\n\n- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.\nNormally this means \"slow down, and do it now!\".  \n\n\n> turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional\n> signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???\n\nWe only have a couple signals.  \"Slow down\" is her either tapping me on \nthe back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency\nof the matter :-)\n\n\"Turn here\" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is\nalso the sign for \"cool!  Look at that.\"  \"I hafta pee\" is the same sign\nas \"turn here\".  \"I'm hungry\" is the same sign.  \"Go faster\" is usually\ndone by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see \"slow\ndown\" more often than \"go faster\".\n \n> I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that\n> she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...\n\nThe best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and \npillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're \nin almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because\nyou as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely\nfeel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes\nat any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  \nPillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.\n\nAlso, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up\nthan by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and\n\"in the Zen of the moment\" less.

I mean, it was the\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\nwere starting to come up strong.\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\nteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\ndon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\"There's no time to hate, barely time to wait\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter)\n\n       \n"}

The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around.\nThe pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries\nto the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well.  Heck, with\nthe five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an\ninjury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though).\n\nThe bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice\nis catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too\nmuch offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, the\nCleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainly\nwouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the\nBraves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting\nover .300?).\n\nThe bullpen... well, it IS suspect.

While\nI'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples\nof rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.\n\n1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.\nSo have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.\nUnless the league notified teams this year about not allowing\ncomplaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.\n\n2)  It's not as if Gant was \"in Hirschbeck's face\".  Gant said\nsomething about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away\nfrom Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but\nwith a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick\non a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box,\nif for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on\nthe experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry\nat the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than\nturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,\nespecially at a key moment in the game.\n\nWhen Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant\nto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck\nwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.\nGant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck\nwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of\nus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and\nHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on\nthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the\ndugout.  Cox was tossed \"protecting his player\".  I was pleasantly\nsurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.\n\nIt's a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,\nMark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play\nGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.  I will\nkeep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the \nfuture, in order to improve my sample size.\n\nIMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was\na bad game for the umpire.\n\nEric Roush\n"}

You guys must all think I'm\nnuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this\narea and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state\nas well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:\n\n- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know \n  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I\n  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,\n  \"Ka stands for K automatic\"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that\n  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high\n  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.\n\n- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,\n  even the real sneaky ones.\n\n- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here\n  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used\n  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.\n\nSo in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting\nmonths for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high\nperformance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal\nto their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that\nEscort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully\nrelied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at\nleast quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.\n\n\neliot\n"}

Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left\nfield.  After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would\nhave helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt\nit.  Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player.

Probably, but how do you know?\nIf you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won,\nperhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha\nCentauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed\nin mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).\n\nWas Babe Ruth a good player?  He played on some WS-winning teams, but did\nhe have anything to do with their success?\n\nIt is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and\nJarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't.  It seems to me that anybody who\nwould deny this needs to provide the proof.\n\nNow, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically\nand by looking at the rulebook.  It is necessary to score more runs than\none's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs\nand to prevent one's opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a team\nis batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that\nmaking outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendencies\nto hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent\nfrom year to year.\n\nWe do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To make\nsome flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than\nGene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies\nin the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but\nwill also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turned\nout to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.  As a matter of fact, I\nam pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given\n3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random\nchance (and almost statistically significant).\n\nIf you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in\nthe World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure\nlikelihoods, however fuzzy.\n>\n>It is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally\n>meaningless.\n>\nSo how about \"real life\"?  Person A robs a service station with two people\nin it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced\nfor three years.  Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a service\nstation with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is\nconvicted.  Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons\ntotally meaningless?\n\nSay you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always\ntesting this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time).  You\nhave never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so\nall previous evidence is meaningless?  Or would you be surprised if it flew\nout the window instead of hitting the desk?\n\nDavid Thornley, who has no replica World Series rings, but does have tickets\nto the 1992 World Series in the Metrodome.\n\n\n"}

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\n\n Switzerland:\n\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\n              31 Samuel Balmer\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\n \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\n\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\n Attendance: 8,600\n\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\n\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\n \n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\n\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

We\nalso get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The\nGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach\nabout what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don\nisn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were\nDon got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the\nBoston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill\nme in on this info?\n  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday\nmorning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off\nsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave\nhigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not\njust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player\nin the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour\nis a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman\nabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?\n  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from\ncity to city.\n  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>\n              is the best two-way player in the league today.'\n \n  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he\nbasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.\n  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario\nLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs\nfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the\nWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about\nLemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion\nif I'm in a different city.\n  Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get\nthis off my chest.\n \nLaurie Marshall\nWayne State University\nDetroit, Michigan\nGo Wings!!!\n"}

It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes\nthe situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet\nmust buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed\nmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my\ntruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts\nrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet \nsays that the noise is \"a characteristic of the transmission.\"\n\nAlso, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the\ngear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about\n55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,\nthe RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should\npoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a\ndetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They\ndropped the compression ratio, supposedly for \"engine longevity\"\nreasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.\nOther things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times \nso far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being\nshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between\nstabilizer and control arm fell off).\n\nAny company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What\nreally bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt\nto deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for \nthem to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new\nFord F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never\nbuy another Chevrolet.\n\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\n"}

My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...\nthat's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting\nsomething rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much\nanyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a \ntorque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still\n(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe\nI don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion\na little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are \nmy questions:\n\n1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the\nwind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds\n(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my\nvision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece \ndetachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.\n\n2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the\ncrash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming\nout from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so\nthat you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it \nreally picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the \nheadlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators\ndon't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm\nputtering around in the dirt at low RPM?  \n\n3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\nin the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section\nof the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? \n\n4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\nwith alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\nthe engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \nparticular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\n\nThanks,\n\n/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\\n|                                                                |\n|     DoD# 88888           asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu      |\n| '90 Kawi 550 Zephyr               (Erik Asphaug)               |\n|  '86 BMW R80GS                                                 |\n\\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/\n"}

One of them is the ERA statistic for\n: pitchers. What does it say ??\n\nERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per\nnine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned\nrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA\nis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided\nby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.\n\n\tERA = (ER/IP) * 9\n\nAn earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed\nto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented\nthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.\nEarned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base\nwhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:\n\n\tIf there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If\n\tan error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after\n\tthis error and NOT counted as earned runs.\n\n\tIf a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game\n\tbefore the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who\n\twere left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,\n\tand the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are\n\tattributed to the pitcher who left the game.\n\nI hope this explains things for you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoe\n\n\t\n\n\n"}

Press conference next week\nOrganization: University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada\nLines: 23\nNntp-Posting-Host: swanlake.cs.ualberta.ca\n\n\nI heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.\nOiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference\nnext week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed\nto concern the Oiler's future.\n\nRumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\nwith Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\nPocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\nthe deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\nrenegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\n\nNorthlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\nbut the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\n\nAs for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\nsupportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\nteam, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\nthat the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\nthan many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if\nthe team does move, there is no place more deserving than\nHamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand\nrealignment scheme of Bettman? \n"}

Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal\nRipken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players\nin the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and\nLarkin, 4.7.\n\nThe top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E.

Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and\nneck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one\nhad the better year can be considered a toss-up.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\n& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as \"dogs\"\n& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\n& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\n& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?\n\nMotorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very\ncorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  \"speed shifting\"\n(which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\n\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.

I think\nbatting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special\neffort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the\ndelaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are\ninteresting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control\nof the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and\nshould, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins\nhas pointed out, there are rules that cover this.\n\nOne of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its\nopen-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going\nto zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to\ngo on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,\nand some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who\nwant constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel-\nsurf and cater to their short attention spans.\n\nHeather\nHHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu\n"}

Anyone out there who might be\nable to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,\nplease e-mail or post!\n\n1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,\n   there is usually a loud \"thunk\" from the rear of\n   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.\n   What could cause this?  Is the differential going\n   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,\n   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,\n   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the\n   trunk!)  \n\n2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from\n   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves\n   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the\n   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?\n\n3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable\n   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is\n   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to\n   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel\n   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes\n   might help -- could anything else cause this?\n\n4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting\n   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from\n   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more\n   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.\n   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put\n   through all the gears and then back to park, as per\n   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.\n\n5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have\n   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps\n   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are\n   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?\n\nI'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners\nout there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,\nthese cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted\ninto taxis.

Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers,\n1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you\ncan get him out 3 times out of 4?\nThen there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even\nthough he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in\n227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run.

My wife and I picked this game to go to\nand thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox\noffense.  Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder\nby Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who \nthrew to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense\n(many non-trivial groundouts).  The game was amazingly fast,\nas the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also \nworking fast.  The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off\nQuantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single\nwhich Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.\n\nGreenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it\nhas always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was\nan MVP candidate).  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a\nafter striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson\nmade an \"ok, I've got to stay focused\" gesture which Iron Mike\ninterpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the \nnext two times.  As Valentine noted, last night he came up in\nthe first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game.\nCan you say \"take the first pitch\"?  Not Mike, who dribbled it\ninto a 6-4-3.  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a \"batting\npractice fastball\".  Next time up he also hit the first pitch,\na hard liner straight to KGJr in center.  He also made the\npathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked \ncomparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight\nreel that night).\n\nIs Riles suppsoed to be good defensively?  I couldn't tell from\nthe field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DP\nthat cost a run or two.  Why was he leadoff?  I hope Fletcher\ngets well soon.\n\nAlso on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond\nme.  It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good\ndefense (a wag behind us said \"He sure don't want to go back to\nCalgary!\")  There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth\nbecause they'll likely lead off the second (as Boone did).\n\nWell, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in\nLangston.  A reminder that contest entries are open through next\nWednesday -- I expect a surge of pessimism.  By the way, ties will\nbe broken by earliest entry.

Whether it's a cheap shot or not you\n\tcan't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks\n\tsimply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this.\n\tThey knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not\n\tpay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who will\n\tadd some toughness to the team will help insure that next\n\tseason other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously \n\tcheck our skill players, or to take cheap shots.

Response welcomed.\n: \n: PS.  my initial question is \"how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW\"\n: \n: Derek \n\nThere is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights.\nIt will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs\nthe possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try\ndi it yourself. \nYou wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.\nWhy is reseting so important? The only reason for doing\nit is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. \nForget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every\n15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and\nextending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait\nfor the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. \nI bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed\nthe oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,\nair and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils\nand done almost all of the other things req for service 1\nand a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights.\nAfter a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.\n\nGood luck!  \n\nBlair\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlair E.

The evidence\nis mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may\nhave been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.\n\nAnd anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in\nrush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.

What turned me off were the\nincessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores.\n2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials.\nThree downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!\n\nEarlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I\nbelieve institutionalize slow play.  I don't mind the cat-and-mouse\ngame with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly\nI would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What\nI object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first,\nor when the game is a blowout.  I don't mind when the pitcher steps off \nthe mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter\nsteps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to\nis when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.\nWhen a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders\nand for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the\ndelays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the\ncommercial breaks in football.  \n\nI understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to \"speed up\"\nthe games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move\nthe markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address\nthe problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the\nsponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything\nto enhance the experience of the fans.\n\nSimilary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the\nones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly\nlong periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching\nthe Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone\nwatching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an\nopportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that\nwas present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would\neliminate that aspect of baseball.\n\nOn the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful\nenough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they\nare actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games \nout the way that they do.  I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting\nthere.\n\n\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nMark Singer    \nmss@netcom.com\n"}
{"group": "rec.sport.baseball", "text": "From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson)\nSubject: Hits Stolen -- Left Field 1992\nKeywords: defense left\nOrganization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 105\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kevin\nBass would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra \nBases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nGonzalez, L.    63    28    20   .192    .866\nGilkey, B.      52    23    14   .150    .941\nClark, G.       46    11    11   .065    .726\nAlou, M.        20     3    12   .052    .835\nBonds, B.       54     9    -7   .019   1.099\nMay, D.         21     0    -7  -.020    .659\nGant, R.        31    -5    -2  -.021    .715\nBass, K.         0   -24    -4  -.126    .600\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n1.099 Bonds\n .941 Gilkey\n .866 Gonzalez\n .835 Alou\n .726 Clark\n .718 *NL Average*\n .715 Gant\n .659 May\n .600 Bass\n\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nRaines, T.      53    22    20   .111    .896\nAnderson, B.    65    30     8   .102    .924\nHenderson, R.   43    20     4   .101    .984\nVaughn, G.      55    27    -3   .095    .817\nGladden, D.     25     4     8   .038    .699\nHall, M.        29     6    -2   .017    .756\nMack, S.        38     6    -8   .005    .866\nPolonia, L.     10   -11    10  -.019    .647\nMcReynolds, K.  13    -8    -9  -.064    .711\nMaldanado, C.    9   -21   -12  -.105    .714\nReimer, K.       5   -18   -16  -.102    .671\n\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.984 Henderson\n.924 Anderson\n.896 Raines\n.866 Mack\n.817 Vaughn\n.756 Hall\n.733 *AL Average*\n.714 Maldanado\n.711 McReynolds\n.699 Gladden\n.671 Reimer\n.647 Polonia\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must \nbe; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage \nof the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is \naffixed to the door frame of the vehicle. \n\nEither way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search\n(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.\n\nCall your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor\nVehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your\nrights are.

(The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting\nvs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly\nthere would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My\n*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently\n(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might\nbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players\n(as opposed to all baseball players).\n\n  As a counterexample to \n>what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\n>\n>               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\n>               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\n> \n>Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\n>Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\n>\n>If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\n>situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.

It is interesting\nthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also \nlooked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),\nhitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has\nbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting \nrecord is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would\nnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based\non his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988,\nbut you may indeed be right.  \n\nWhen I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and\na more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately\nbelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.\n\nThis probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\nwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\nhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\nit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\nstatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\n\n\n>BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with\n>'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\n>something better than the 99.9% confidence level.

The passenger\nseats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't\neven usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my\nback by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the\nreasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had\na BMW. :)\n\nI'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains\nor some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.\n\nThe best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:\n\n- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort\n  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on \n  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop\n  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.\n\n- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider\n  asks you to :)\n\n- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements\n  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,\n  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.\n\n- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably\n  consistent shifting style).  Avoid \"helmet bonk.\"  Helmet bonk is \n  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change\n  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It\n  gets old real fast.\n\n- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep\n  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands\n  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,\n  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.\n\n- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be \n  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're\n  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.\n\n- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or\n  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed \n  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n"}

Otherwise, it just stalls when\nput in drive.  \n\nMy thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting\nstuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up\nconverter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least\nlikely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum\nhose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of\nvaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).\n\nMy background is that my father owns a service station and\nI worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please\nfeel free to be as technical as you want. :)\n\nI'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free\nbeer. <grin>\n\nSkoal,\n\nChris\n"}

Not when you stop at a STOP\nsign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the\npegs until you tell her to get off the bike.\n\nb) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough\nthat she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And\n(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as\npossible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your\nballs up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.\n\nc) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't\nlean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.\nDon't look over your shoulder.*\n\n3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That\nmeans don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than\nusual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have\nthe equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't\nhave to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.\n\n5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things\nof interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get\nso focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives\nher ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.\n\n* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended \"look over the rider's\nshoulder in curves\" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of\nher weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,\nunlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the\npillion's view of the road ahead).

He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.\nIn both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres\nthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of\nhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. \nEven in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to\nindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been\nfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)\nthrough the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open\nup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on\na breakaway to salt away the game).  There\nis no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the\nvictory. \n\nIn my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as\nLaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get\nextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev\n(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense\n, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton\nplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)\nThe difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. \n\nGary\n\nGo Sabres!\n"}

If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops\ndrastically.  Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000\nrpm.  The top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  Standing still\nthe engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K).\n\nOther phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the\nengine becomes a little wavery.  That is, at a steady throttle the\nengine speed goes up and down slightly.  The bike has about 13000 miles\non it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk.\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. \nMy thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.  I'm\nhoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth\nthe hassle of any major engine work.\n\n                                        Thanks,\n\n                                        Britt Park\n                                        britt@cb-iris.stanford.edu\n\n\n"}

A \nplayer's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.\nA player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated\nbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics\nwe can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  Put in \nsome simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of \nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \nAdding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\n\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\n \nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\n\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\nsituations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\nmeasure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \n'84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the\n96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88,\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\nyou'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\nis not statisically significant.\n\nBTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with\n'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\n\n>\n>\n>>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand \n>>\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three\n>>\tis a VERY clutch hit.

It originally\nhad a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based\non the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear\nand a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was\nlimited as a performer.\n\nThere has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other\nmodels.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that\nwere also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer\n1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,\nand a \"sport coupe\", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there\nwere two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900\nengine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also\navailable as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,\nbut was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.\n\nIn 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last\nyear for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations\nand the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing\nto build the GTs.\n\nThe 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the\nManta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with\nBosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and\nwider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century\nlow price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by\nthe Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them\nOpels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.\n\nVarious models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the\n70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.\n\nParts are still available from a number of sources.\n\n(I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could\ncollect in 20 years).\n-- \nJohn Kennedy                     uunet!opel!johnk\nSecond Source, Inc.              johnk@secondsource.COM \nAnnapolis, MD\n"}

Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any\nplayoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,\nthey will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this\nis still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but\nit is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.\n\n\nI asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was\nnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time\nwithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon\nis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.\nShe told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf\nwas shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come\ncontractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She\nthen couldn't give me a coherent answer.\n\n\nAlso, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game\nattendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks\nshould begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with\n thier sports programming.\nI hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain\nbitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts\nsince they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.\n\nThe lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes, the reason\nis low ratings. Then another time, she says contractual obligations.\n"}

If I were Bill Clement I would\nshoot myself.\n\nAnyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show\novertime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going\nto happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even\nthe boring Devils game.\n\nOverall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly\nbelive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract       \nobligations*, screw you ESPN.\n\nPraise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!\n\nGO HAWKS!!!\n\nJB\n"}

I've never changed the brake fluid except when\nhaving a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of\nfreeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventative\nmaintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agents\nthat can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the\nsystem, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless\nyou are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just for\nyour info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for\nflushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't\nknow if it was more without the brake job.

{"group": "rec.sport.baseball", "text": "From: sam@steamer.clam.com (Sam Mandelbaum)\nSubject: Yankee Thoughts\nOrganization: CLaM Associates, Cambridge, MA 02141\nLines: 76\n\n\nYes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\n\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \n    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield\n    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \n    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years\n    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as\n    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan \n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take \n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\n\n2.  Wade Boggs.\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\n    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\n\n3.  Spike Owen.\n    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\n\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\n    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing\n    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\n\nWhat I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \nwill be ready in a year or two.  \n\nI'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\nthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\norganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\nenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball\nhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!\n\nSam \"I'm not Militello or Millitello\" Mandelbaum.\n\n\n\n"}

What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000?\n>You can hardly claim that he is \"hurting his team\".\n\nIt would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the\nApril 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average\nand a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks.\nThe reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history\nof showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for\ndrawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced that\nthere was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'd\nnot only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in\nthe history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove? Look at some of the\nother fluke players at this point in the season:\n  Player    AVG AB\n  Blauser  .367 49\n  Grace    .391 48\n  Milligan .400 35\n  Conine   .375 40\n  Lansing  .400 50\n  Slaught  .406 32\nAre any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significant\nis Galarraga's average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If\nhe'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good\ndefensive play, he'd be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next\ngame he's all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let's\ntalk then.\n\n>If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches\n>and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen),\n>*THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches.

Sheesh.\n\nIt's history, Greg. Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because he\nswings at bad pitches, so his average isn't very good. 45 AB's doesn't mean\nan awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when\nthere's ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn't\nchanged. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never\nwalks, but don't bet the rent money on it.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nFrom an historical basis, Middle East conflicts do not last a long time.\n\t- VP Dan Quayle on Nightline, 2 October 1990\n"}

Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force\nin the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while\nover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was \neverybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just\nto keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a\nlot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.\n\nBryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good\nplayers, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And\nno doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\npossible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.\n\n>So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.\n>Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings\nwise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which\nI outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with\nat the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player\ncannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone\nreading this will agree.  \n\nWe'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they\nface each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,\nlike last year).\n\n>Gregmeister\n\n--Randy\n\n"}

His\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\n\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF,\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\nML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)\n\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \nspeed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have \na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my best\noverall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\nto 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\nscarce.\n\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't get\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it these\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\nI'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\nto an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach\nhustle.\n\nAll that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term\ncontract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible\nin 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve and\nlimitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's\ngot some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances\ndown the road with Nieves et al.\n\nEric\n"}

The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, \nand/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They\nalso used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the\noriginal trannys breaking under the load of the 427.

Sorry Ken, but Jeff King does have some power, which\nmeans his SLG won't be below .300, and his walks are *way* up.  If\nthat increase is real, Jeff King will be an above average NL third\nbaseman in 1993.  Jose Lind, on the other hand, *still* doesn't walk,\nand clearly isn't a .320 hitter.  My bet is that he won't be getting\nany extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the \"Lind Shift\"\nwe were seeing in the NL.\n\n>Any predictions as to when he is sent to Buffalo or released outright?\n\nNo, although since the Lavalliere weirdness, nothing would really\nsurprise me.

Jagr,\nMacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one\nelement of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.\n\nDespite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing\nadantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and\nkeep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens\nbottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to\nconfigure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new\nlooks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.\n\nBowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an\nindividual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed\nof Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As\na result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played\nalmost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern\nscored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.\nHis ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is\ncommendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might\nsimply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about\nsuccess.\n\nWhile no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson,\nBowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly\nseen, mark in  Pittsburgh. \n"}

{"group": "rec.autos", "text": "From: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)\nSubject: REVIEW: Audi S4 quattro\nOrganization: skulls 'r us\nLines: 175\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)\nNNTP-Posting-Host: lanmola.engr.washington.edu\n\nIt's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit\nto an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he\nmakes a not too sucessful living selling them.\n\nWithout further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:\n\n\n1) Servotronic steering:\n\n[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the\nname for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and\nused in Audis and BMWs.]\n\nI have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past\ncouple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of\nthe Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\nruined.\n\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\nsome makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and\nthere is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for\nimprovement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\n\"feel\" and engineer it out completely.\n\n\n2) Engine\n\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\n\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the \"overboost\" feature\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\na heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\n\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\nmatch its grunt.\n\nThe only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\n\n\n3) Chassis\n\nI've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \n\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\npony cars.\n\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\nable to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\n\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\nwell too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to\nbrag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on\nanti-lock capability.\n\n\n4) Comfort\n\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\nbecause Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \n\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\n\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't\nconsider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough\nto sway a potential buyer.\n\n\n5) Conclusion\n\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\nit doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker\noffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is\nworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also \ntop notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant \nautomatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series\nAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my\nthumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being\nall out exciting and intoxicating.\n\n\neliot\n\n"}

I think\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \n\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\n\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\nwon in their building, we're going to win in ours\".\n\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\nresulting in a goal.\n\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\nthe Leaf players \"Don't let them score on you\".\n\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\ninstant replay.\n\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his\nplay.\n\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\nthat he can't play the way he should, because of the league's\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\nproblems.\n\nDon's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don't fight\nbecause they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\nwouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\n\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\nsomeone gets cut every period.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported\nby Murray.\n\nI'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.\n"}

I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of\n6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good\nas he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise\ncontrol and threw the ball up there and let the batters \"get themseleves out\"\n(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out \ntrying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a \nveteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in\nbaseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra\n(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.\n\nYes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change history\nto suit the present.  \n\nBTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a \nveteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more\ncan he be embarrassed?\n\n> \n> From where I sit, I'll let others have the excellent players - I'll\n> settle for good enough and the ring :-)\n\nditto!\n\n> \n> Joe Leonard\n> jle@world.std.com\n> \n\neddie \n"}

The stats show he\nis a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened\nto win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good\ngames. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was \nconstantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)\nand the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in\nhis 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would\nleave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win\ngames (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).\n\n\nBarry Walker\nBNR \nOttawa\nCanada\n\nMy opinions\n\n\n"}

Here are the highlights:\n\n\n            R     H     E\nTexas       1     4     1\nDetroit     3     5     0\n\nWells gets the win, he's now 3-0 with an ERA just under 1, and Henneman gets\nhis third save in three chances.  Ken Rogers started for the Rangers and \ngets the loss.  He was relieved by Burns in the 7th.\n\nThe Rangers got their only run on a solo home run by Dean Palmer in the 7th.\nThe Tigers opened the scoring with an RBI single by Fryman in the 3rd, then\ntook the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when Whitaker greeted\nreliever Burns with an RBI double which scored Tettleton.  Whitaker in turn\ncrossed the plate on an RBI single by Phillips (who has been red hot) for \nthe third Tiger run.\n\nThis afternoon, it's another battle of southpaws, Bill Krueger for the Tigers\nvs. Craig Lefferts for the Rangers.\n\n--Randy\n\np.s.  Toronto Blue Jay fans, thanks for Wells and MacDonald!  Those guys\nhave really been a big help to the Tigers pitching staff!\n"}

Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\nrecently rare power with their bats.\n\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \nbreaking balls.\n\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\n\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \nlater score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \nafter 4.\n\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\nTom Prince's two-base passed ball.  \n\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K'd\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\n\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\nwork.\n\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \nbruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for \"precautionary\nX-rays\".  Let's hope he's OK.\n\nCincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the\ntwo wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!\nPittsburgh is now 7-6.\n\n*********REDS FANS***************************\nIf you would like to receive this report on a \nsemi-daily basis (as often as I write it), \nsend me your e-mail address and I'll put you \non the list.

{"group": "rec.sport.baseball", "text": "From: dtate+@pitt.edu (David M. Tate)\nSubject: MVP '92 Revisited\nKeywords: mlb, 04.20\nOrganization: Department of Industrial Engineering\nLines: 93\n\nTim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average\nstats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive\nperformances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my\nposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total\nrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for\nreconsideration of the MVP award.\n\nMajor caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if\nSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the\ninfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are\nposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and\ninflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about\ncatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions \nof Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  \n\nHaving said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look National\nLeague first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.\n\n\tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal\n\n\tSandberg\t  44\t\t  32\t\t 76\n\tBonds\t\t  67\t\t   3\t\t 70\n\tWalker\t\t  26\t\t  26\t\t 52\n\tJustice\t\t  14\t\t  33\t\t 47\n\tDaulton\t \t  44\t\t  ??\t\t 44+?\n\tLarkin\t\t  36\t\t   4\t\t 40\n\tGrace\t\t  13\t\t  27\t\t 40\n\nAs I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.\nIf you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you\nget essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it\nwouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  Darren\nDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,\nand I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.  A good case \ncould be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.\n\nMy personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.\n\n\nIn the American League:\n\n\tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal\n\n\tVentura\t\t  22\t\t  34\t\t 56\n\tMartinez\t  47\t\t  -1\t\t 46\n\tB. Anderson \t  21\t\t  25\t\t 46\n\tThomas\t\t  47\t\t  -5\t\t 42\n\tR. Henderson\t  25\t\t  16\t\t 41\n\tRaines\t\t  17\t\t  23\t\t 40\n\tTettleton\t  33\t\t  ??\t\t 33+?\n\nOK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top\nplayer in the AL last year?  I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time\narguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only\napproximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those\nof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.\n\nOnce again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as\nimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke\na guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that.\n\nMy personal vote (excluding pitchers):\n\n\tVentura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.\n\nI'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of\nbalanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher\nleverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with\nnegative defense.\n\nFor the record:\n\n\tCarlos Baerga\t\t  27\t\t  5\t\t  32\n\tRoberto Alomar\t\t  35\t\t -2\t\t  33\n\nForget it; it's a wash.\n\nLet me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding\nDon Mattingly's defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his\nweak '90 and '91 to end up with\n\n\tMattingly\t\t  -1\t\t  17\t\t  16 runs\n\nwhich is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it's still 18 runs\nbehind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John\nOlerud.  On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and\nevery other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.\n\n-- \n   David M.

Gas is much more expensive, so people are very\nconcerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,\nalong with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with\nsmaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh\nwell with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with\nautos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a\nmanual.\n\n(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the\nmoney for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to\ndrive through the slushbox.)\n\nAs automatics become more efficient, the \"bigotry\" is probably\nreduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are\ncheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there\naren't compelling reasons to go automatic.\n\n-dB\n\n-- \n"}

BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me\nnowhere.  After being routed to a \"Firebird Specialist\", I was able\nto confirm that this is in fact the case.\n\nAt first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.\nShe wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some\nshipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they\nsimply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she\nwas pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,\nfeel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.\n\nSecond, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related\nto the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is\na production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was\nnot wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore\nhaving to wait for the right high quality parts...

I'm not\nshy about it.  I'll make the statement again.  I believe that by\nseason's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations\nwill be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch\nsituations.  I can't prove that it will happen, so I guess we'll \njust have to wait and see.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - -\nHere's another one for you.  In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter's batting\naverage in clutch situations was significantly below his batting\naverage in non-clutch situations each year.  I presume you think\nthis is random.  \n\nNon-Clutch:\t1585 AB\t\t411 H\t\t.259\nClutch:\t\t 338 AB\t\t 68 H\t\t.201\n\nSo what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter?\n\nWell, his composite BA through 1989 was .268;  through 1990 was\n.262;  through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good\nidea of what kind of batting average he can produce.  In 1992\nhe hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: \n\nNon-Clutch:\t 536 AB\t\t144 H\t\t.269\nClutch:\t\t  86 AB\t\t 20 H\t\t.233\n\nNo, this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can\nbe used to predict future performance across the breadth of \nmajor league ballplayers.  It just makes me think that in 1993\nJoe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be\nas high as his ba in non-clutch situations.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n \nAs for #1 (above), I have plenty of company.  John Dewan of STATS,INC. is\nthe editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding\nclutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text.\nBill James makes numerous references to a player's ability to hit\nwell in the clutch.  I am not saying that I can predict the future\nany more than they are.   You (and others) are saying that your\nwork renders their statements (and mine) meaningless.  I don't \naccept that, which in your words proves that I am a \"total idiot\".\n\n\n\"Stupid\".  \"Total idiot\".  \n\nMy, my.

If players' performance was completely random\nin (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be\ngood in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.\nWith two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each\nyear, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.\nWe have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd\nexpect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.\nThis is what we actually get--\n\nNo. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5\nClutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3\nCoin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3\n\nEssentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years\nof good performance is the same as what you would get if the process\nleading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.\nIf there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)\nthat had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of\nplayers at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping\na coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\nIn the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\nreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, \nyou'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  \n\nEverything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period\nof years that could be used to predict any ability with any \nproposed definition has looked like a random process (with the \ncaveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage\nthat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein \nprobably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-handed pitcher,\nbut he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would\nbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his \nplatoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced\nat casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into \nstudying it and every one of them, with the exception of the\nElias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow\nyou to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better\nthan flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the\nflaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-\ncoming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.

If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston\nsoft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then\nof course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.

If the alternative\nwas Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with\nViola.\n\n>Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the \n>other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge,\n>Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly).\n\nYes.

By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra\n>(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.\n\nWell, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that\nMorris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,\nthis is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better\nthe rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes\nconsistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the\nteam's credit.\n\nFurthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would\nbe projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done\nthis in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot\nworse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.\nDo you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.\n\nLook at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical\nMorris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not\nresponsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team\njust didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did\nduring much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't\nearn him a victory.\n\n>BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a \n>veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more\n>can he be embarrassed?\n\nMorris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start\nanymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.\n\nGreg \n"}

Being me, of course, I\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\nhere's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\nsubstantially right.\n\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\n\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\nbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,\n30 batting, 25 fielding.\n\nTotal RAR (bat/field)\n\n1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)\n2.

There wasn't exactly a radical\nshift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The\nonly real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if\nhe stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been\nquoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the\nDucks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,\nand he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder\nwhether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those\ninjuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an\nearthquake collapsed the root cellar.\n\n>Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal\n>contributions before he was fired, so it's not clear that this would have\n>been different.  Besides, they *were* marginal contributors.\n\nLet's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly\nKisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong\nobjections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do\nwith both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.\n\nImagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine\nhadn't jammed.\n\n>With or without Mullen, they weren't going to be a playoff team; what good\n>does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere?  \n\nEspecially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\napplicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your \nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone\nwho looks like you, too.\n\n\n-----\nTommy McGuire\nmcguire@cs.utexas.edu\nmcguire@austin.ibm.com\n\n\"...I will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information,\nidentifying it as personal and as independent of IBM....\"\n\n"}

How many such\nchances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances\nto catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is\nmuch higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there\nis value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line\nor in the dirt.  \"Good Hands\" are needed for such plays, and thus have\nvalue.  I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences\nof these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are\nsimilar.

Bowers)\nNNTP-Posting-Host: yfn.ysu.edu\n\n\nIn a previous article, gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (Gary W. Mahan) says:\n\n>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but\n>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.\n\nIt's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is\nusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car\nwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a\npoorer Cd. \n\nTo calculate drag use this formula:\n\nD = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S\n\nWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),\nV is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the\npieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure\n(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). \n\nNote that power is:\n\nP = F * v\n\nWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v\nis velocity (ft/s). \n\nNote that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for\nforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power\nresult in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. \n\nSo if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top\nspeed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)\n\n101 mph\n\nSorry to dissappoint.\n\n\n-- \nAl Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA\n\"Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?\"\n                                             -Mary Chapin-Carpenter\n"}

Note\nthat I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the\nquestion at hand.\n\nSuppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10\nand win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population\nof people who play this game every week.\n\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\nwill win 7 or more times.\n\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\nbe 7-time winners.\n\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\n\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\n\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\nsuppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\n\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics,\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\n\n>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\n>with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\n>history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\n>it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\n>statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\n\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn't\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\n\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn't\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\nway.\n\n>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\n>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\n>basis? \n\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\nand then reverses.\n\nCheers,\n-Valentine\n"}

Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.

To the best of my knowledge, the\nonly things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section\nof the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.\n\n2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hampered\nby the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.\nProject Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You\ncan call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their\ndatabase, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could\njust log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having\nattempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they\njust don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the\ninformation available at all.\n\n3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too.\nI am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers \ndesire to have the book come out sooner than April.\n\nHope this makes things just a little bit clearer.\n\n(Bias alert.

{"group": "rec.sport.hockey", "text": "From: hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu (Valerie S. Hammerl)\nSubject: Sabres/Bruins notes\nOrganization: UB\nLines: 57\nNntp-Posting-Host: lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu\n\n\n \nIt was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of\nnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  \n   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three\ngames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a\nbest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this\ntime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.\n   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice\nadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It\nwasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.\n   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting\ngoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.\nBuffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on\nthe powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.\nLaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was\nKhmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres\nstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and\nHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a\nshot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob\nSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of\npenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get\nhis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes\nlater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied\nthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.\nLast year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet\nrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a\ntip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.\nBoth teams finished with 34 shots.  \n        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.\n        Referee--Rob Shick.\n\nComments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of\nclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic\nagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead\nflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea\nto Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever\nheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was\nonly five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no\none took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,\nnoted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was\ntoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as\nmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev\ndidn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't\nskate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each\nwere out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in\nan interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he\nresponed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than\nthat, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The\ninterviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he\nmust not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh. \n\n-- \nValerie Hammerl \t       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab \nhammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside,\nV085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.  \"I wanted to learn how to \nget that feeling, and the only way was to learn how to skate.\"  P.

Wow!\nA lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe\nwalk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.\nThe pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after\nthem with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers\nwould rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.\n\nKen Kubey         kubey@wpd.sgi.com  (415) 390-3536\n"}

The base-walk allows\n>the runner to \"challenge\" pitcher to throw over to the base.\n\nIt may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the \npitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,\nso he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of \nsound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness\nthat could result from this kind of rule.

When it runs, it runs well. \n> \nGood point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things \nwhich come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.\nThe fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let\nsuppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the\nvacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough\nto open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, \nsince the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, \nand as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. \n\nOne way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side \npanels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the \ncorrect size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output\nside of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make\nsure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum \nto the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check \nfor air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is\na vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it \nflows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in \nthe vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog \nor partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced \nto fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control\nhose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.\n\nNow if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there \nis something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, \nI would be typing all day to list them all! \n\nHere are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve\nand open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the\nairbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are\nquite a few on each carb.\n\nI hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American\nHonda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and\ncall the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recall\nit off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days\nlater a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked\nthe support I received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!\n\nBuy the service manual on the F2, it is an invaluable source of information\nfor working on your bike and I might add, trouble shooting!\n"}

Suggestions?\n\nGlad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for\nabout two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:\n\n     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have\n       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the\n       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I\n       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my\n       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your\n       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright\n       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)\n\n     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually\n       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give\n       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.\n\n     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors\n       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see\n       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out\n       of the way *now!*\n\n     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I\n       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from\n       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).\n       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice\n       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.\n\nNow, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line\nthat I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape\nroute is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that\nyou don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line\n(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up \nnext to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided\nthat hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.\nAny other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind\nyou?\n\n-rob.\n\n--\nRob Griffiths  | Erasure.ShonaLaing.WildSwans.B52s.U2.JudyBats.REM.Smiths\nrobg@apple.com |  FAA Certified cloud basher  I wanna drive the Zamboni!\n"}

To the non baseball junkie this is boring.\nAt any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid\nfan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on\nT.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major\nLeague Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of\nshortening the game.

I'm sure someone out there in net-land has some\nfacts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity\nsold.  But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider\nwhat is happening on a team-by-team basis.\n\nWhen the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the\nlost revenues from alternative sources.  One of the best sources may\nbe ticket sales.\n\nExample 1:\tThe Dodgers\n\n\tThe Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales\n\tand *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise\n\tprices without hindering revenues.  I certainly think that is\n\ttrue.\n\nExample 2:\tThe Padres\n\n\tThey will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year.\n\tIf they raise prices, less.  If they want to increase their\n\toverall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a\n\twinning team on the field.  But given that won't happen (it\n\twon't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket\n\tprices and running frequent promotions.  Will they do that?\n\tI have no idea.  But they won't increase prices, because it\n\twon't work *for them*.\n\n\n>2) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners\n>   decrease ticket prices, that does not decrease the tv contract.\n\n\nThe only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place.\nEach team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to\nbe faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those\nmarket forces.

Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 118\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Juan\nGonzalez would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra \nBases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nNixon, O.       34    12    15   .083    .777\nGrissom, M.     48    18    12   .072    .812\nJackson, D.     46    13    20   .060    .735\nLewis, D.       25     8    -6   .029    .596\nDykstra, L.     25     5    -5   .013    .794\nDascenzo, D.    10    -5    10   .001    .616\nFinley, S.      32    -2     2  -.003    .759\nLankford, R.    39     4   -12  -.007    .844\nMartinez, D.    21     5   -16  -.017    .660\nVanSlyke, A.    30    -4   -17  -.040    .846\nSanders, R.      7   -10    -4  -.059    .759\nButler, B.       1   -29     5  -.088    .716\nJohnson, H.      3   -12   -19  -.118    .548\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n.846 VanSlyke\n.844 Lankford\n.812 Grissom\n.794 Dykstra\n.777 Nixon\n.759 Finley\n.759 Sanders\n.735 Jackson\n.730 *NL Average*\n.716 Butler\n.660 Martinez\n.616 Dascenzo\n.596 Lewis\n.548 Johnson\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nLofton, K.      57    32    17   .220    .947\nWilson, W.      47    26     0   .125    .787\nWhite, D.       52    25    28   .119    .812\nFelix, J.       22     0    32   .063    .713\nDevereaux, M.   43    16     0   .047    .832\nMcRae, H.       38    11    -1   .038    .631\nYount, R.       31     8    -3   .022    .737\nKelly, R.       13    -6    -3  -.025    .681\nJohnson, L.     23    -5   -13  -.040    .641\nGriffey, K.     15    -9   -12  -.052    .844\nPuckett, K.     13   -13   -15  -.063    .801\nCuyler, M.       6   -10    -6  -.088    .503\nGonzalez, J.     0   -21   -15  -.095    .738\n\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.947 Lofton\n.844 Griffey\n.832 Devereaux\n.812 White\n.801 Puckett\n.787 Wilson\n.738 Gonzalez\n.737 Yount\n.713 Felix\n.709 *AL Average*\n.681 Kelly\n.641 Johnson\n.631 McRae\n.503 Cuyler\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable\nthan the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.  \n\nThe differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,\njust the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is\nbarely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that\ncan only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line\nwith screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;\nit's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come\nwith the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're\ngetting better and making the move in the right direction.\n\nThey beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only\nin words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the\nend of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part\nsince there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't\npress Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.\nBesides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.\n\nI do not put much stock in the mag rags' \"inside\" information, or even\nFord rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was\nfinally disclosed in it's entirety.  \"Inside\" information had the\nTaurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look\nfor a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself\nif you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new\ncar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been\nbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those\nmodular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and\ncompetition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.\nAnd there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,\nwho really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.\nHighly.\n\nThe next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts\nway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage\nis more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and\nbelieve Ford will forfeit that.\n\nI submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit\ndefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,\nintelligent, critical spews like, \"The Mustang bites, man!\"  Some of\nyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro\nwill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the\ndifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.\nThe Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its\ncab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still\nreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to\nthe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while\nthe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.\nBoth will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be\nno clear winner.\n\nUnless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe\nthat it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?\n\n:^)\n\nRegards,\n\nBrian\n\nbqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI am the engineer, I can choose K.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDepartment of Engineering Mechanics\nOhio State University\nColumbus, OH\n"}

You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North\nAmerica.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the\ndistributors) are not interested in manual trannies.\n\nThe '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.\nI have an '87 300E, with a \"mere\" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that\nit has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always\nnice, but I can't complain.\n\nI test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:\n\n1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.\n2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel\n   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously \"hook\" into\n   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful\n   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it\n   does not have this problem.)\n3) Huge interior and cargo space.\n4) The most \"rubbery\" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It\n   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.\n   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.\n   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed\n   the car for an automatic.\n5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does\n   not exhibit these characteristics.)\n\nYou should also check out the new BMW 525 \"touring\".  This is a wagon version\nof the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.\n\n--\nMichael Chmilar\nchmilar@apple.com\n"}

All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad,\nbut at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing\nbefore he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a\nfish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything\nhe wants to him.

He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times.\n\nUnless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my \"career minor\nleaguer\" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the\nSharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He\nneeds to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some\nversatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't\nparticularly good as a goon.\n\n-- \n Chuq \"IMHO\" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com\n   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ \n  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)\n  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)\n   San Jose Sharks fans: sharks-request@medraut.apple.com (New seat: 127/TBD)\n\n"}

The blue book is just\na hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650\nfront end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.

Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear\naxels, ford 9\" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i \nbusted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and \nhaven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to \nrot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones\nthat might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly\nTTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were\nas the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective\nwheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few\ndings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were\ndiscontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top\nfor 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you\nhave the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over\n400 bucks to replace.

There is no significant *ability* toi\nperform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every\ntime there is a game-winning hit.

There will be such hitters in any league,\njust as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.\n\nAnd there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between\nclutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,\nprobably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather\nthan any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to\npinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch\nhitter in the past.\n\nBut there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.\nDoes the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of\nSabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a\nreal ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you\nhave a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?

{"group": "rec.sport.hockey", "text": "Subject: Flames Final Stats and Playoff News\nFrom: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.ca\nOrganization: Mount Royal College, Calgary, Alberta\nLines: 118\n\nNews:\n=====\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \na major part of the team. \n\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \n\nThoughts on Game 1:\n==================\n\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \n\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \n\nThoughts on Game 2:\n==================\n\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \n\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \n\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \n\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \neach other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)\n \nUpcoming games:\n==============\nFriday April 23, at L.A.\nSunday April 25, at L.A.\nTuesday April 27, home to L.A. \nThursday April 29, at L.A.

He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help\na team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and\nMakarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just\nbite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him.

While he believes that Clark-Bonds-\nWilliams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit\nahead of Williams.

He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant\nWilliams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season.\nBut, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive\nhitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in\nthe 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams.\nWilliams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open\nbecause of the threat of Bonds stealing.\n\n\n\n"}

The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.\nThe score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.\nIs there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little\nslack?

In my car it smoothed the idle\nand reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough \nto test for wear, but some people I know have.   \n A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors\nat least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50\nhe has went 5 years without an overhaul.\n\nAlso a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K\nmiles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers\nhad ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals\nof the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be\nexpected of 30K miles not 200K.\n\nIn my opinion it works.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nBeware!

After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the\nmiddle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he\nwouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles\nby about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out\nthink Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.\nDoes anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And\nif he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an\nerror or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced\npast him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether\nVizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.\n\n\n\n--\n--------------------------\nPhil Brown                |\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |\n--------------------------\n"}

I'd like to give some feedback based on\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\n\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\nwas another trap.  And there was!\n\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\ntrap when there was none.\n\nI've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\n\n                                       -Barry\n-- \n-----                                                                   --------\nBarry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com\nChelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319\nChelmsford, MA                                                 \n"}

In general, you\nshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He\ndid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the\nslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he\nslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a\nLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I\nwas very disappointed.\n\nYou're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least\nin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and\nfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's\nwhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk about\nthese issues).

Almost every car I've ever owned has been\na 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I\n(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty\nhigh-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with\ntorque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the\nhighway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I \nprobably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been\naround 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the\n\"control\" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out\nto be very convenient.

The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe\nlook like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow\ntread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.

Goneso in five games, and it saves\nus Caps fans a lot of pain.\n\nI mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them \ntumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times\nhave they done that in their history?\n\n1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight\n1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight\n1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight\n\nIn other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they \nwere a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being \n\n1) a sweep of Philly in 1984\n2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME \nthey managed to get out of the division.\n\nActually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps\nare famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:\n\n1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,\ngave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the\nlast minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.\nSeries tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.\n\n2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd \nperiod, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.\n\n3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.\nBlew it and the series.\n\n4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.\n\n5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.\nBlew it again.\n\nWhen they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: \"if they blew this\nlead, the series is OVER\". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders\nbelieve they can come back no matter what the score is.\n\nI am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can \ncompletely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear \nlives in a crucial game.\n\n>The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.\n>P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!\nWell, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps\nwere frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking \"wait\nuntil Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire\". Well, they retired (even though\nTrottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another\ngeneration of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess \nit has nothing to do with the players.\n\n-- \n                                          Edward Lor\n                                          lor@cbnewsk.att.com\n                                          \n"}

Overtime time games\n    that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would\n    have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin\n    with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!\n\n    However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the\n    ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break\n    whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the\n    deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this\n    would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.\n    should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the\n    N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the\n    damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to\n    watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must\n    let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody\n    out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.\n\n    Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....\n\n    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall\n    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the\n    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the\n    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was\n    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall\n    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for\n    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about\n    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player\n    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,\n    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that\n    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,\n    on the resulting PP and\n    eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the\n    outcome of a game.\n\n    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking\n    obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the\nlevel of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.\nThis has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.\nHowever, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace\ntheir balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got\nany.\n\n    All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.\n\n    Steve\n\n    \n"}

I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking\nat their watches and shouting \"Hurry up!\"  If I cough up big bucks for a \nticket, I don't mind a game that last more than 2:10.  I really don't\nunderstand it.  \n\n\tGames are longer now for several reasons:  more pitching changes,\nmore basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factor\nis the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancy\nshowboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the\nbatter's box.  My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this\nan issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotel\nbar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase\nstewardesses around the bar.  Sure they want the game over with.  Print \njournalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games:\nthey have deadlines.

I don't like to see stickwork,\nbut you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move\n(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back\nof their skates when the ref isn't looking.

I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming\nconvinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\nchance to do it a lot.\n\nLet's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\n\n\n\t\t\tPower\t\t\tNo Power\n\n\tPatient\t\tFrank Thomas\t\tBrett Butler\n\t\t\tBarry Bonds\t\tOzzie Smith\n\t\t\tMark McGwire\t\tCraig Grebeck\n\t\t\tBabe Ruth\t\tMiller Huggins\n\t\t\tTed Williams\t\tBilly Hamilton\n\t\t\tRickey Henderson\tEddie Joost\n\t\t\tJoe Morgan\t\tMike Hargrove\n\t\t\t   .\t\t\t   .\n\t\t\t   .\t\t\t   .\n\t\t\t   .\t\t\t   .\n\n\tImpatient\tErnie Banks\t\tOzzie Guillen\n\t\t\tDave Kingman\t\tShawon Dunston\n\t\t\tJoe Carter\t\tAndres Thomas\n\t\t\tGeorge Bell\t\tJose Lind\n\t\t\tKirby Puckett\t\tDevon White\n\tetc.\n\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the\ntwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at\nthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;\nhe's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all\nover the place, despite his huge strike zone.\n\n\n-- \n   David M.

The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can't stand it!\n\nAside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good \non most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston\nplayers can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net\nexcept for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent\njob clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed\nbut he's also getting plenty of help.\nBoston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the \nseries score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the \ngame.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period\n2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single\ngame (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite\nbleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have\nan excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the \n2nd and 3rd periods.\n\n(The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.\n   I'll never cheer for the Sabres...

I do actually quote some things\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\n\"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\nI want to say.\n\nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:\n>But the point is that the only decision making pro-\n>cess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\n>lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\n>inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\n>is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nThere's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\nteam and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\n\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto 'humans', and \"organ Z\" onto\n'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'\nabove might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\n\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\n\n>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\n>solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\n>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\n\n>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens\n>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a\n>criteria, then fine.\n\nIn this cases, we're seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\n\n>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the\n>individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only\n>measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.\n\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\nit's unclear what it all really means.\n\n***\n\nNow just one more un-related point:\n\n>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a\n>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference\nbetween the winners and the losers.\n\nMoreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\n\n>The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it.  There is no new\n>knowledge being produced.  \n\nSince stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\neven though I'm relying on stats to do it.\n\njking\n\n"}

The Jets\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \nnumbers that counted: goals.\n\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\n\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \n\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\nthe score 2-1. \n\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\nallowed to set up and make plays.\n\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\n\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\n\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\n\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \nbackhand even though he was off balance. \n\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\nfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.\n\tNext game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.\n- 30 -\n\n\n"}

Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nThis episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was\npointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,\nand Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)\n\nRon Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a\nhotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of\nall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter\nand Fuhr.\n\nDon began to praise Fuhr, calling him the \"greatest goalie\", and\nsaid that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.\nHe then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when\nFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised \"Don't Trade Fuhr!\"\n\nDon went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would\nbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the\ntrade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.\n\nThe next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by\ntoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver\ngame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.\nRon said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,\nbut Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi\nhitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: \"Its sad what\nthey're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.\"\n\nNext, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.\nPeople in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke \"Wendy\" for not fighting.\nHowever, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.\n\nThis lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how\nbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: \"It's like college\nhockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.\nThat's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you\nwon't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made\nby people who don't know what's going on in hockey\".\n\nThe final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out\nthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip\nof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was\ntaught to \"play to win\", which differs from today's idea of\njust letting kids have fun.\n\nAt then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's\ncorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like\none of the chipmunks.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some\ngood quotes.\n\nI'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

My previous\ncar had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. \nThe locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory\nservice manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was\nsupposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking\nnut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no\none ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking\nlugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, I\nfound out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid\nof the locking nuts. :-(\n\nMy present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the\ndealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.  They have been made to\nbe exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the\npackage and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems\nwith the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I did\nhave some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire\nbalancing.\n\nTom\n"}

ABout\na year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        \nleaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid\nback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and\ngot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem\nlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months\nlater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure\nthere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I\ndidn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch\nhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I\nwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the\nproblem.\n\nI should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the\npedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in\norder to actuate the clutch.\n\nMy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,\nthe angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the\ncylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.\n\nWhat do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix\nshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?\n\nNow the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain\nwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the\npassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which\nthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What\ncan you suggest here?\n\nMany thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...\n\nBill Christens-Barry\ncerulean@access.digex.com\n\n"}

The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.\nSince the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless \nI do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a \"popping\" or \"hitting\" sound.\nThe dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say \nthis is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?\nAnd about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK\nwhile attempting to put it in reverse:\n   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.\n   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is\n      fully depressed.\n   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.\n   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was\n      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if\n      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)\n   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having \n      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),\n      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.\n   6- The shifter acted normally after that.\n\nWhen this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the \nclutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.\n\nI had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last\nweek.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because \nMitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the\nproblem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while\nthey had the car.  \nIn all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,\nand since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed\nto the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily\nsolving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to\nsend someone to check the car while it was stuck. \nI KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting \nfrom 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get \nthe dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, \nand with how to handle Mitsubishi.  \nAll hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to\nbore you with the long post.\n\nThanks,\nRabih.\n"}

Game winner in OT in game 1, and another\nBIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why\nGrant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered\na minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being\ntied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I\nthink Boston would have notched their first win of the series.\n\nWell, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but\nI certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually,\nthey've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt\nthat would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more\nheroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I\nthink Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging\na new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not\ngonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange\nthings happen in both pro and college hockey.\n\nTalking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball\nswing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev\ndeflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a\ntesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out\nin the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The\nSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in\nthe opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in\nsuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres\nwon a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)\nwhen LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his\nshot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps\nover to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting\nit up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,\n\"They score, THEY SCORE!!!\".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping\nup and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating\nover to Brad May who he jumped on.\n\nDoug McKee\nmckee@cs.buffalo.edu\n"}

The \"official line\" in MSF\ncurricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying\nboth brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and\nboth tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to\nprevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more\ntraction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to\nweight shift.\n\nThe \"official line\" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face\nof it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage\nof all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the\navailable braking power by using only the front at time 0.\n\n>>Saying, \"brake until the tire just begins to slide\" is next to useless\n>>advice to a newbie.

I'm not suggesting that you should always\n>aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the\n>limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. \n\nNot necessarily true.  \"Chirping\" the tire indicates impending lockup\n(on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate\nmaximum braking.  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally\nmakes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an\nexperienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like\nCode used to use.\n\n>In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep\n>both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing\n>exactly as *you* suggest!!\n\nTrue, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills\n(which is how this discussion started), \"keep both wheels just on the\npoint of sliding\" is nearly useless information.

Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last\nyear, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andres\nhas a \"weak\" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the\nball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.

Do share the details.\n\n\tHOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55\n\nIt's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding day\nof spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Grab\nall your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium\nor better.  Head out.\n\n\tIn Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of\nGilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.\nHaving just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it\nfor a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, I\nwent into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,\nand started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt\njust right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a\nbit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mph\ngrab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail\nto notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist\nthe throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see\njust how well she's been put back together.\n\n\tAt 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was\nflexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my\nhelmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny\npack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper\npulled in all hot and flustered.\n\n\t\"Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?\"\n\"Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,\nnot the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, and\nI'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic.\"\n\t\"My radar says you were at over 145mph.

I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or\npitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow\nwalk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason\n(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of\nreach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).  \n\nI want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy\nwatching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much\ndead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch\nit on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like\nthat college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game\n(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next\nyear: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next\nyear, and they're going to a 35 second clock).  \n\nThere's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm\nwatching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going\nto an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not\nwilling to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's\nrevenue from me.\n\nSherri Nichols\nsnichols@adobe.com\n\n\n"}

It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself\nhave never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience\nof that visit and of an observation of \"SQUILDLY\" behavior by other \ncustomers and/or sales personel:\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nI ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into \"cruiser\" type bikes. My\nfriend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He\nwanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer\nthat sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. \n\nThe place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few \nIntruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.\n\nWell the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I \nmoseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.\nI could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),\nbut I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured\nto each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs\nfirmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the \"hormone gang\"\ntalking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big\ndeal.\n\nHere is the part that concerned me. The \"HG\" and those shop personel that were\nnot busy with customers went back out, where said \"HG\" members fired up their\nrides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,\none decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.\n\nSQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager\nnot only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they\nwere betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely\nas he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her\n\"pilot\" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers\ncould be heard as well as felt.\n\nI felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those\nin cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and\ndamning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little\nuncomfortable and we left. \n\nI will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my\nanger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open\nmind and doesn't associate me with them. \n\nBTW, I can't afford a new bike.....\n"}

The main reason is that\ngood hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)\nare rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a\nplace to put aging veterans.\n\nAnother use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury\nslowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the\nfield.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did\nduring the rest of the season.\n\nA third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first\nor the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie\nJackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he\nhit like the old Reggie when he was in right.\n\nThe second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by\ntheir primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60\nat DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.\n\n> \tA logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement\n> value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.

Although the\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job\nanywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\n\n\n--\nDavid Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu\n\"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.\"\n\"Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again.\"\nDisclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.\n"}

After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time \nto do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often\nfalls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  \n\nStrawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like\ndemands.  I suspect that a comment like \"I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm\nused to it\" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if\nit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,\n\"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best\nin that role.\"  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like\na fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question \nlike, \"How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?\"\nA more media-sensitive player might answer \"The manager knows what he is\ndoing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I\nam all for it.\"  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a\nlittle bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.\n\nPersonally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't\nmatter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,\nexcept for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that\nquestion, \"The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get\npaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing\nto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team.\"  or something like\nthat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was\nhitting third--and make him sound like a \"team\" player.  Since Strawberry\nwill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for\nhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   \nhis image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.\n\nRemember, the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hit\nfourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is\ntrue.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Jeff\n"}

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays\nreally well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths\nis not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he\nallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you\nshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third\nperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they\nwould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular\ngoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they\nare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like\nSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there \nare any legitimate excuses. \n\n>Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces \n>[description of lucky bounces.....]\n>Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... \n\nI am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.

Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\n\nWhat you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the \ngame was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you\ncould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what\nif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\n\n>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\n>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. \n\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.

You can adjust\nit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without\nsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the\nSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false\nalarms with this system.

My Syclone is so tight\nin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are\nsupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't\nhave one.
